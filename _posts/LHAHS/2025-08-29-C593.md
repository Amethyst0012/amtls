"As soon as Professor Harrid requested a special exemption, coincidentally, second-year student of the Department of Magic, Carl Thomas, made it into the Hero Record."

The chairman of Lumene.

Altec Zeron reviewed the documents submitted by Harrid with an expressionless face.

Known as the "Infinity Speller," he was one of the top ten most powerful active magical heroes.

Although he held the position of chairman of Lumene, he typically operated on the front lines near the Tartaros border.

Since he had taken charge, the demonic activity in his designated zone had decreased.

A hero whose mere name exerts strong deterrence.

Conversely, if he were absent from his post for too long, that region might become the target of concentrated attacks from Tartaros.

In fact, the area he oversaw was one of the most critical strategic points in the conflict with Tartaros.

For that reason, he often entrusted the role of acting chairman to his daughter while he remained absent.

Besides Elena, the mage with the Mystic Eye, Albi, also served as a professor at Lumene. With Zeron’s capable talents leading the board, his absence wasn’t a critical issue.

Thus, it was extremely rare for him to appear at Lumene in person.

The only reason Altec had come to Lumene this time was because of the reappearance of the Flame of Calamity.

Even though the front lines were vital, once a disaster like Erebos' Flame had appeared in the rear, he couldn't simply continue guarding the front.

Though the incident had been suppressed without major damage, Altec needed to return to Lumene to properly deal with the aftermath.

It was in that context that he learned about Carl.

"Professor Harrid’s report is certainly intriguing."

By talent alone, Carl should have hit his limit in the first semester of his first year, yet he had survived until the second semester of his second year.

That alone was quite unusual.

"He’s resourceful."

Lumene’s curriculum was structured to only allow talented students to advance.

Since not everything can be overcome through effort alone, students lacking the necessary talent for Lumene naturally fell behind.

"Even if he endured the second year’s first semester with the mentor system..."

It was partly due to luck that his mentee, Juen, happened to be the top of the first-year magic students.

"Luck can also be considered a skill, but this is slightly different. The student named Juen has shown remarkable growth."

Among the current first-years, Luke was showing the most rapid development.

But Luke had started from nothing.

Still, to rise from the bottom to the top of the year was astounding.

"But with overwhelming talent, the time to let that talent bloom, and a supporter to accelerate that growth, nothing is impossible."

In fact, starting from zero might have made his growth even faster.

With a good mentor, one avoids learning unnecessary things and focuses solely on what's essential for growth.

However, for someone already skilled, rapid growth is harder to achieve.

"At the time of admission, he was considered a step below Aina Beidna."

Yet, in the first semester’s final evaluations, he displayed skills on par with Aina.

If it hadn’t been for the inherent advantage between a knight and a mage, the outcome could have been different.

His growth was more impressive than that of Haviden from the Knight Department or Sasha from the Summoning Department, both of whom were considered Aina’s equals.

And considering Haviden and Sasha were growing at a strong pace themselves—

"It might be more accurate to say that Juen had excellent judgment in choosing her mentor."

Carl had fulfilled his role faithfully.

He made it past the midterms and up to this point.

Just the fact that he had become a hero made Altec want to evaluate him highly.

"A supporter, huh."

A student type that had never existed at Lumene before.

He barely passed the written exam.

But he would absolutely fail the practical.

Which meant he would fail the promotion exam.

It was a shame.

Altec had wanted to see how he might develop further at Lumene.

Still, granting a special exemption was a different story.

Even if the student was interesting—

Even if the request came from Harrid, a long-serving faculty member of Lumene—

Keeping a student with insufficient grades at Lumene was unthinkable.

It would be discrimination against the other students.

"But if he’s registered in the Hero Record, the story changes."

In Lumene’s history, very few had become heroes while still students.

"Especially in the second year—only Leo Plov did that."

And Leo was a monster beyond comparison.

"No, Carl Thomas isn’t a conventional hero either."

He wasn’t a monster like Leo.

But he stood apart from the many heroes who had made the Hero Record before him.

"If he’s reached hero status, I see no issue in granting him a special exemption. What do the board members think?"

"That’s unacceptable."

"Agreed. Even if he became a hero, exemptions are out of the question."

Several board members voted against it.

Altec looked at his younger brother.

"Albi, what do you think?"

"Carl Thomas is certainly an unusual student. Personally, I rate his potential quite highly."

Though Albi didn’t teach a regular class at the Department of Magic, that didn’t mean he ignored the students.

In special training courses related to magical combat, he had observed all of Lumene’s magic students.

As the Mage with the Mystic Eye, he carefully watched each student's talent.

"But by principle, I believe exemptions are unacceptable."

"Hmm."

"However."

"However?"

Albi raised the report and said, "Lumene is a Hero Academy. Its ultimate goal is to turn students into heroes. For thousands of years, it has continually revised its curriculum to achieve that goal."

"Indeed."

"And now, a new type of hero has emerged. One that breaks the existing mold. That means new possibilities have opened."

Albi looked around the board.

"In a way, Carl Thomas already meets graduation conditions. It's rather strange that a student who has already become a hero would still be learning at a school designed to produce heroes."

"Hmm."

"Mmm."

Several board members showed discomfort.

They were traditionalists.

Those who had defined the hero archetype.

They couldn’t accept a hero like Carl Thomas.

"The world is changing. If we don’t move quickly, we’ll be left behind."

"What do you mean?"

"Lumene must understand what qualities got Carl Thomas recognized as a hero. If the gods acknowledged him, it means a new age of heroes like him is coming. If we expel Carl Thomas based on outdated standards, it will only hurt Lumene."

Albi spoke calmly.

"If Carl Thomas is expelled, another hero academy might snatch him up."

"Are you suggesting there’s a school that would accept a human like him?"

When one board member frowned, Albi smirked.

"There’s no rule saying a hero academy only accepts students of the founder’s race. Don’t forget there’s even been interest in transferring Leo Plov."

No one answered that.

"Whether we intended to or not, we raised this hero. There’s no need to hand him over to someone else."

Altec nodded.

"Then let us proceed with a vote on Carl Thomas’s special promotion."

{bl}

“Hehehe!”

Aru spread her chest wide.

“The Heiress of Brave's Will.”

At Leo’s mutter, Aru showed a proud expression.

“Isn’t that the perfect title for me?”

As she spun around lightly, Lunia crossed her arms.

“An overblown title.”

“Yours is overblown too, you know?”

“What? I got a staff from Lady Luna!”

“Well, I got a sword from Lord Aaron!”

As the elf and beastkin bickered, Drianna intervened.

“Stop the childish fight and be proud of your achievements.”

She forcibly separated them.

“You’re both impressive, seriously.”

“Hmph.”

“Hehe.”

Though Lunia snorted, she didn’t seem to dislike the compliment.

Aru scratched her head and giggled.

“On that note, let me paint your beauty for future generations—”

“Don’t be gross, pervert.”

Both Lunia and Aru scowled at the same time.

“Anyway! Black Rabbit! I’ve finally caught up to you!”

Aru pointed dramatically at Leo.

Leo nodded.

“Yeah, yeah. Well done.”

“Don’t treat me like a kid!”

As Aru flared up with her tail raised, Lunia sighed and muttered,

“As if she’s really caught up.”

Becoming a hero was a tremendous achievement.

But compared to the great hero Leo, it was like a firefly under the moon.

*‘Still, we must reach him someday.’*

Lunia clenched her fist as she looked at Leo.

“By the way, what’s with you spacing out?”

She looked at Carl, who sat blankly like his soul had left him, with a pitying expression.

“I’m a hero... Hahaha... A hero I only dreamed of... Acting student council president again next year... Yay~. So exciting... Ha. Ha. Ha.”

As Carl muttered like a broken doll, Drianna slapped his back.

“If you’re a hero now, act proud! Why the gloom?!”

“Gah! Gahk?!”

Small but strong, Drianna’s slap flattened Carl.

He dusted himself off and stood up.

“Right. This is something to be happy about.”

Slap!

He slapped both cheeks with his hands, his face serious.

“Time to stay sharp.”

“Oh. That’s a pretty decent look you’ve got now.”

Drianna grinned.

Carl looked at her and said, “I’m never posing nude for you.”

“Tch.”

Drianna clicked her tongue at Carl.

“Hey! Carl! Our hero!”

Eliana came running.

Behind her were Chelsea, Nella, and Tade.

“Where were you until now?”

Carl looked confused.

His friends had vanished the moment they heard the news.

Eliana grinned with a thumbs-up.

“We were preparing a party!”

“A party?”

“Yep!”

Eliana beamed.

“To celebrate your promotion to third year. Everyone’s amazed, saying it’s a miracle.”

Chelsea chimed in.

Seeing them, Carl looked touched.

“I guess I’ve lived a decent school life, judging by the friends I’ve made.”

As he got teary-eyed, he tilted his head.

“But why isn’t anyone congratulating me on becoming a hero?”

Chelsea and Eliana glanced at each other and said,

“Because your promotion is the real miracle here?”

“Exactly.”

Seeing how in sync they were for once, Carl grimaced.

“I’ve wasted my life.”

“Don’t say that!”

“Yeah!”

“No! I mean, I became a hero! A hero! Isn’t that the real thing to celebrate?! Oh! Don’t tell me—”

Carl grinned mischievously.

“You’re just jealous that I’m a hero now, huh?”

At that, Eliana flinched, and Chelsea scowled.

Carl smirked triumphantly.

“Ah~ Even my friends are jealous now. The burden of being a hero is heavy indeed.”

“You’re so annoying!”

Eliana glared and grabbed Carl from behind.

“Chelsea, punch his gut. Go for the solar plexus.”

“Got it. Hold him tight.”

“S-Save me!”

As Chelsea clenched her fist, Carl paled.

“We’re third years now, but you guys haven’t changed a bit.”

Tade sighed as Nella laughed behind her hand.

“That’s our Class 5 charm, right? Don’t you think, Leo?”

Leo let out a soft chuckle and nodded.

“Oh, right.”

Leo seemed to recall something.

“Carl, what’s your title?”

As Leo asked, Carl, barely freed from Eliana’s grasp, replied, “Oh, that?”

He scratched his head and laughed awkwardly.

“The Herald of the Beginning.”
