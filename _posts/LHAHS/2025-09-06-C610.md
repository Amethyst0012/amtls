Step, step---

"This isn’t just a simple royal palace."

Leo muttered as he walked down the hallway of the palace.

Throughout the entire palace of Tonkan, a powerful aura of elementals could be felt.

"Is it the elemental domain?"

Tonkan had shared its history with the Elemental Lord of Fire, and as such, the area had become like a domain of the elementals.

*["It seems they’ve completely settled here."]*

Elsie, who revealed herself, sat on Leo’s left shoulder and spoke.

The elemental domain.

Literally, it referred to a space occupied by elementals of a specific attribute.

This land had long been home to the elemental of purification.

*‘This used to be a volcano, right?’*

And if the palace’s location were compared to that of an ordinary volcano---it would be right in the center of the crater.

*‘Rather than the royal palace of Tonkan, this is more like the palace of the Elemental Lord of Fire.’*

Judging by the lingering aura of elemental in the air, it had been elemental-dominated for hundreds of years.

"The dominion is incredibly strong."

*["That’s only natural. Ishtar was more powerful than Undine a few decades ago."]*

At Laruel’s words, Leo nodded.

Elemental Lords usually held power equal to each other.

Sometimes, an exceptionally powerful Elemental Lord would be born---but that was rare.

If the powers were equal, there was no ranking.

But the strongest Elemental Lord undeniably existed.

The measure of a Elemental Lord’s power.

It was the number of elemental under their command.

So-called dominion.

How many.

And how powerful the elemental were under them.

That too was clearly a measure of a Elemental Lord’s power.

*‘Elemental contractors who form pacts with Elemental Lords usually fall into two types.’*

Some maximized the Elemental Lord’s raw power.

Others wielded the vast number of elementals under the Elemental Lord’s control.

In Leo’s case, it was the former.

*‘Lysinas excelled at both.’*

Depending on the situation, Lysinas would change combat styles.

Sometimes she fought armed with the power of the Elemental Lord, while other times she would overwhelm with sheer numbers of elementals.

*‘Well, during the Era of Calamity, the number of elementals had greatly diminished, so she often relied more on the raw power of the Elemental Lords.’*

Recalling Lysinas, Leo looked down at his hand.

At his will, Lysinas’ jet-black mana stirred.

The mana that had settled in Leo’s body as a reward for conquering Lysinas’ world.

*‘Sometimes it moves on its own, against my will.’*

Leo silently stared at the jet-black mana, but it gave no response.

Clenching his fist, Leo murmured.

"Anyway, why did Ishtar take Celia?"

When Celia had been taken, the elemental’s power hadn’t felt hostile.

*["Ishtar is an elemental with a strong desire for display. Ishtar blessed the royal family of Tonkan for many years, partly because their ancestors had fought alongside him---but also because they were a bloodline capable of drawing out his power to the fullest."]*

Laruel clicked her tongue.

Elsie made a face of realization at those words.

*["Ah, so by forming a pact with the royal family of Tonkan, Ishtar could call himself the strongest Elemental Lord."]*

To a elemental, a contractor is someone who amplifies their power.

Depending on the contractor’s capability, even power beyond their limit could be drawn out.

*["Yes. And the royal family of Tonkan revered Ishtar as a holy being. A prestigious family that both drew out his power and treated him with reverence. Perfect conditions for that vain parasite "]*

to latch onto.

Laruel said with a sharp tone.

"But Celia has no talent as a summoner."

The progenitor of Zerdinger was blessed by the power of a phoenix.

But just because the power source was mythical beast being didn’t mean she had summoning talent.

*["That guy doesn’t care about such things. He just sticks to anyone who can make him shine. Total airhead.']*

Laruel spoke with a tone of contempt.

Being the eldest of the existing Elemental Lords, Laruel had a deep understanding of the others' personalities.

Hearing this, Elsie tilted her head.

*["Then wouldn’t Leo be more fitting? He’s already a hero, more famous as an All-Class. Why Celia?"]*

Laruel clicked her tongue at Elsie’s words.

*["Ishtar definitely sensed my presence in Leo’s mana when he touched the city gates. And he probably sensed the presence of those fools too."]*

*[Chirp---chirp---]*

*["Fools?! Apologize!']*

*["Ack! That glare from Laruel!"]*

Fiora flapped her wings and chirped, and Kiran flailed his hands in the air in protest.

Alty rolled on the floor, wrapping herself in her arms.

*["What does it matter that he formed contracts with all of you?"]*

*["Huh?"]*

Laruel looked a bit flustered at Elsie.

As Elsie tilted her head in confusion, Kiran spoke.

*["Wait? I heard Elemental Lords are really picky about contract conditions. Is that not true?"]*

*["Is that so?']*

*["Yeah. I heard if you’ve already contracted with one of the Three Great Mythical Beasts or another Elemental Lord, they refuse to contract.']*

*["Really? Leo?']*

"That’s what I’ve heard too."

*["Ah, so that’s why Ignis called Leo a playboy back then.']*

Elsie nodded in understanding.

Laruel, watching Elsie, asked in a flustered voice, *[" Miss Elsie, you’re not bothered that Leo contracted with other Elemental Lords?"]*

In truth, when contracting with Leo, Laruel had secretly been watching Elsie for her reaction.

*["Not at all. I’m rather happy he’s making new friends. Ever since Laruel formed a contract with Leo, things have gotten more lively and fun.']*

*["Ahh! How benevolent you are!']*

Laruel clasped her hands with a moved expression.

*‘Well, Elsie doesn’t have the possessiveness that other Elemental Lords do now. She was born during the Age of Calamity, after all.’*

*["Come to think of it, didn’t Lysinas form pacts with all the Elemental Lords 5000 years ago? Was that because the situation was urgent?"]*

Back then, Luminus, the Elemental Lord of Light, was gravely injured in battle with the legion commander, Gluttony King Jörmungandr, and fell into a deep slumber to avoid destruction.

Elsie, the Elemental Lord of Darkness, had perished fighting the Lich King.

Thus, only the four Elemental Lords remained.

And all of them had pacts with Lysinas.

Seeing Elsie ask with curiosity, Leo answered indifferently.

"They refused the pact at first too."

Leo replied flatly, and Laruel sighed.

*["So even the predecessors were the same. But how did the Wise Queen get them to agree? Were they moved by her?"]*

"I persuaded them with fists."

*["Excuse me?']*

"I beat them until they agreed to contract."

*["…… Leo, you did?"]*

"No. Lysinas did."

Even among the Elemental Lords, the summoner famed as a legendary figure.

The Wise Queen, Lysinas, beat up the Elemental Lords because they wouldn’t form a pact.

Laruel couldn’t help but stare blankly.

For reference, when the foul-tempered Kyle and Luna attacked someone, they made fierce expressions.

But Lysinas didn’t.

She smiled.

Which made her even scarier sometimes.

"If the world is in crisis, and they’re clinging to pride, then yeah, they get hit."

Leo clicked his tongue.

Of course, the Elemental Lords hadn’t refused out of mere pride.

There was also the concern that one person couldn’t possibly handle all four Elemental Lords.

That concern disappeared after the battle.

*["I can’t imagine it."]*

*[Beep……]*

Kiran and Fiora couldn’t believe it either.

*["Ahh! A contractor who beats you if you refuse! I love it!']*

Alty was delighted.

Then.

Clank---clank---

The sound of metal clashing rang out.

Leo looked straight ahead.

There, knights in red-tinted armor approached him.

"Elementals?"

They looked like fire elementals clad in armor.

*["Not exactly a welcoming atmosphere."]*

Leo smirked at Elsie’s comment.

"Indeed."

*["How arrogant."]*

Laruel ground her teeth.

"Then I’ll just have to prove it to them by force."

Leo stepped toward the fire elementals.

"Whether or not I’m worthy as a contractor. Elsie."

*["Yes?"]*

"It’s your turn."

{bl}

"Look here, girl."

Ishtar said, holding a flamboyant red dress in both hands.

"This is a dress of flame I sewed myself, stitch by stitch."

Celia took a step back, her face pale as she looked at Ishtar approaching.

She felt a visceral revulsion at the sight of a tall man approaching shirtless, holding a dress.

"Become my knight, and you shall not only rule over Lezentan, but also wear this beautiful flame dress."

"Um… Well, that land is Leo’s inheritance. I’m really not interested."

"Hmph! I care not for human politics. Lezentan has long been my domain. I merely lent it to the noble and loyal House Tonkan!"

Snorting, Ishtar let go of the dress.

Fwoosh---!

The dress turned into blue flames and flew at Celia.

Celia flinched.

The flame burned away her clothes and reformed into the dress.

In the blink of an eye, Celia was wearing it, her expression flustered.

"Hoh, black hair and red eyes suit you. Truly beautiful. Hmmm."

At the appraising gaze, Celia shuddered.

"Truly fitting of the one I’ve chosen as king. Next, the sword. This sword, too, was made by me, infused with my power---"

"I’m not a summoner. I won’t be of much use to you."

At her words, Ishtar smiled slyly.

"It doesn’t matter."

"…Excuse me?"

"Your blood carries the blessing of the flame mythical beast, the phoenix Zerdinger, and the purification spirit, Ishtar. You’re not a summoner, but your blood holds the highest potential."

"So?"

"Bear many children! Surely one of them will have the best qualities of a summoner!"

"……"

"Then I, Ishtar, shall crush that detestable deep-sea elemental and become the strongest Elemental Lord again! And your descendants shall enjoy prosperity!"

Celia pressed her temple.

This Elemental Lord really was a pervert.

At that moment---

"Hmm?"

Ishtar’s face darkened.

"How did someone invade this palace?"

The palace was his domain.

Any anomaly was immediately sensed.

"Laruel. That old hag. Dark Elemental energy? Hah! And even that scheming Ignis? Two Elemental Lords making a pact with one contractor? What disgrace!"

Ishtar looked utterly disgusted.

"Not only did he form a pact with the Three Great Mythical Beasts, now he wants one with me? How arrogant!"

Returning to his throne, Ishtar crossed his legs.

Then he looked at Celia.

"Girl. You traveled with Leo Plov at Lumene, yes?"

"That’s right."

At her reply, Ishtar smirked.

"Then you’ve always lost to Leo Plov, haven’t you?"

Celia looked stung.

It was true she lagged behind Leo.

But phrasing it like that felt insulting.

Seeing her expression, Ishtar grinned.

"Girl, let me show you what kind of power you’ll have if you serve me."

"…Excuse me?"

Fwoooosh---!

As Celia looked bewildered, blue flames erupted from Ishtar’s body.

{bl}

Crash---!

Leo grabbed the helmet of a knight and slammed it into the ground.

"So the elemental itself is embedded in the armor?"

In the past, the Tuzen Order were known as the Fire Elementals’ Knights.

After Tonkan fell and they lost Ishtar’s blessing, that title was lost too.

*‘Seems it was because they couldn’t use elemental-infused armaments anymore.’*

These armors were clearly the gear of the old Tuzen Order.

And their maker---

*‘The purification elemental, huh.’*

So that’s what Ishtar had been using his magic for.

*‘Lysinas and Luna would’ve loved this.’*

Recalling his friends who’d marvel at such wonders, Leo looked forward.

A door adorned with flamboyant flame patterns stood ahead.

Boom---!

Leo kicked the door open and burst into the audience chamber.

Tap---

He stopped and raised his head.

"You’ve come, insolent one."

On the throne sat a tall man with a displeased expression.

"The purification elemental, Ishtar."

"Indeed. Now kneel and show proper respect. Then I shall forgive your rudeness, even if slightly."

Just as Leo smirked and was about to speak---

*["Oh my?"]*

*‘Huh?’*

*["How rude this spirit is."]*

Elsie appeared at Leo’s side.

*["Who are you to look at someone with such disgust?"]*

Her face showed no expression.

*‘Wait? Is she… angry?’*

A rare sight.

No---this reminded Leo of the very first time he’d met Elsie, 5000 years ago.

And it unsettled him.
