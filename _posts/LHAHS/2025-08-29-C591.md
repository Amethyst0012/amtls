The hero candidates, who had been cheering moments ago, slumped to the ground one by one.

The tense atmosphere finally dissipated, and a sense of relief that it was truly over washed over them.

“Ugh, I really thought I was going to die this time.”

“There couldn’t be a single mistake... Is this the kind of nerve-wracking battle that heroes go through?”

“Look, my hands are still shaking.”

Everyone was busy sharing their thoughts on the battle they had just gone through.

They had overcome countless trials while attending the Hero Academy.

But compared to what they experienced today, those trials didn't even count as proper challenges.

They had even witnessed the battle between Erebos and the Great Hero firsthand, but never imagined they’d confront Erebos directly themselves.

“Suddenly, I feel even more in awe of the Great Hero and the Heroes of the Dawn.”

Even Celia, who always displayed perfect composure, sat on the ground shaking her head.

“Ugh! That was so hard!” Aru sprawled out flat on the ground.

It had been so exhausting that she couldn’t even feel the accomplishment of what they had achieved.

Everyone just wanted to rest.

Aru squinted at the sky, her brows furrowed.

The brilliant sunlight pierced her eyes.

As she scrunched her face against the sunlight and started to close her eyes—

Step— Step—

Someone’s footsteps cast a shadow over Aru’s face.

“Huh? Who is it?”

Because of the pouring sunlight, her vision was hazy and she couldn’t make out the face.

Aru’s blue eyes, which were lazily observing the person’s face, suddenly widened in shock.

“Well done. That was impressive.”

As Kyle smiled gently, Aru’s mouth opened in disbelief and she jumped up from the ground.

“Whaaaat?!”

Aru let out a strange scream, and all eyes turned to her at once.

Then, upon seeing the man standing before her, everyone wore an expression of shock.

“W-Wait! Is that real?!”

“Why is he here?! Isn’t this Lumene’s world?!”

“A fake... maybe?”

Everyone looked like they couldn’t believe it.

*‘Leo... oppa?’*

Chelsea widened her eyes and stared at the Hero of the Beginning.

When Kyle made eye contact with Chelsea, he smiled softly.

*‘It is Leo oppa.’*

Even when he had appeared as Leo, he had an aura that overwhelmed everyone.

But now, he radiated an overwhelming charisma far beyond anything before.

*‘Right. This must be his true form.’*

She never believed Leo was pretending to be someone his age.

He’d always been mature from the beginning.

He must have simply hidden his true self and naturally blended in with them.

Sometimes pushing them from behind.

Other times leading the way, showing his back.

Thinking about how Leo had helped them grow without ever revealing himself, Chelsea nodded quietly.

*‘He’s a true adult.’*

She realized that all over again.

“So... handsome…”

Eiran clasped her hands and muttered blankly.

“Eiran, you’re drooling.”

“Ha?! Slurp.”

Startled by Chen Xia’s comment, Eiran quickly wiped her mouth.

“But he really is cool.”

Chen Xia also let out a sigh of admiration.

Those who knew Leo’s true identity were in awe of this new side of him.

Lunia silently observed Kyle.

*‘A goal I must reach one day.’*

Just as Lunia clenched her fist—

“Um... Are you really Kyle, the Hero of the Beginning?” Aru asked cautiously.

“I am. Why?”

“Gasp? H-How are you in Lumene’s world?”

“When I opened my eyes, it was the world 5,000 years in the future. I found Erebos there, so I took care of him. But chasing him led me here.”

Kyle answered matter-of-factly.

“What exactly is this place?”

“This is the Hero’s World.”

Following Aru’s words, Chloe explained about Hero Record.

“Fascinating things exist in the future.”

Kyle said casually.

*‘Leo-oppa’s acting is amazing.’*

Chelsea chuckled inwardly at his performance.

The students, who had been frozen by Kyle’s sudden appearance, began to come to their senses.

Then they quickly gathered around him and bombarded him with questions.

“Lord Kyle! What were you feeling when you faced Erebos alone?”

“What allows the Great Heroes to appear in the present day?”

“Is it true you were romantically involved with Lady Luna?!”

The students couldn’t contain their curiosity and fired questions nonstop.

Though the Great Heroes were revered, there were still countless mysteries surrounding them.

The students, thrilled by the chance to talk to one, didn’t want to miss this opportunity.

As the students of Hero Academy gathered around Kyle, forgetting even their exhaustion—

“What’s everyone doing... Huh?!”

“The Hero of the Beginning?”

Carl, supporting Lumene, looked shocked when he saw Kyle, and Eliza had an expression of utter disbelief.

At that moment, Lumene approached Kyle.

The students stepped aside, forming a path.

Everyone held their breath at the unbelievable sight of a meeting between a Great Hero and a Dawn Hero.

“I... was able to come this far because I admired you. I was even called your successor, though undeservedly. I...”

Lumene clenched his fist.

“Am I worthy to follow in your footsteps?”

Just as the students of Lumene’s world looked up to him and followed him—

Lumene had followed Kyle.

But he had shown disgrace before someone he revered.

Kyle, silently watching Lumene, reached into his cloak.

And pulled out a sword.

An old sword.

The one he had used before receiving Posteritas from Dweno.

“I used this sword for the longest time.”

Kyle handed it to Lumene.

“It’s yours now. I suppose that answers your question?”

“......”

Lumene accepted it with trembling hands.

“You don’t need qualifications to follow in my footsteps. I’m not someone so great that things like that matter.”

“Thank... you.”

“I’m the one who should be grateful.”

Kyle smiled.

“Thank you... for not giving up.”

He gripped the sword tighter.

Kyle’s recognition was more precious to Lumene than anything else.

It felt like a reward for the countless years of effort he had endured.

Turning his eyes from Lumene, Kyle looked at the hero candidates.

“I saw you all fighting.”

The candidates held their breath at his words.

“I considered helping... but it didn’t seem necessary.”

Kyle raised the corner of his lips.

“So be proud of the great deed you accomplished today. Hold your heads high. You will all—”

Kyle’s gaze, which had moved from one cadet to another, finally settled on Carl.

“—become heroes.”

**[World of Lumene: Final Chapter - Sacrifice has been cleared.]**

As he finished speaking, a system message popped up before the students.

Fwoosh—!

With a burst of brilliant light, the Hero’s World returned the students to their original world.

Only two remained in the Hero’s World.

Kyle and Lumene.

Fwoosh—!

Kyle’s body burst into brilliant light.

At the same time, he reverted to Leo.

“My body aches from rampaging after so long.”

Now that Kyle, who had been about the same height, was smaller than him, Lumene couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“No more wandering.”

Leo patted Lumene’s shoulder and said.

“I am me, and you are you. You just need to walk your own path.”

“...I understand now.”

“Then that’s enough.”

Leo put his hands on his waist and stretched.

“How’s the imprisoned Erebos?”

“...Since Seiren revealed your existence to us, he’s been growing rapidly stronger. As if he had been hiding his strength all along.”

“I thought so.”

The fragment of Erebos they had once sealed in Seiren’s world—

It had been a massive shard torn from the main body.

The fragment in Lumene’s world was even smaller.

But its power was similar.

That meant only one thing.

Erebos’s fragments had grown far stronger than before.

“No, he was likely stronger all along.”

Leo narrowed his eyes.

“He’s been using the Hero’s World as firewood to fuel his power.”

The more a flame burns, the stronger it becomes.

Until there’s nothing left to burn.

Hero’s World was both Erebos’s prison and his fuel.

Just as Leo had defeated Erebos and converted his power into divine force—

Erebos, too, must have been absorbing divine force into his own strength.

He must have secretly grown stronger over thousands of years.

And the fact that he suddenly revealed his strength—

“Means he realized your presence, Kyle, and grew impatient.”

“How long can you hold him?”

“I don’t know. But...”

Lumene looked at Kyle’s sword.

“After meeting you, Seiren and Rodia... and I, have all grown more in these past few days than we have in thousands of years. We’ll endure as long as possible. We won’t fall easily. We’ll stop him until the very end.”

“I’m counting on you.”

“Leave it to me.”

Lumene smiled confidently.

And the world began to collapse.

The cleared world started to disappear.

Leo’s body began to shine.

“Oh. I almost forgot something.”

Leo spoke as if he’d just remembered.

“Seiren and Rodia.”

“Yes?”

“Tell that damn elf and rotten lizard—”

“Yes?”

Lumene looked flustered as Leo suddenly started cursing.

“If I see them again, I’m shaving both their heads bald.”

“......”

Watching the growling Leo, Lumene thought

*‘He must’ve found out they called him an idiot and a moron.’*

Shaking his head at the memory of those two, Lumene sighed.

Fwoosh—!

With a burst of light, Leo vanished.

{bl}

A void of nothingness.

In the middle stood a child with gray hair and gray eyes.

Holding a giant book nearly the size of his torso, he opened his mouth.

“We will now begin the Hero Record Review Meeting.”

At his words, colorful orbs materialized in the void.

*"Unexpected."*

A voice of surprise echoed from a light green orb.

*"I thought we would never again be allowed to select heroes."*

“You’re right, Pivua. This meeting is entirely of my own volition.”

*"Keh~ Everyone acted like they’d follow whatever the Hero of the Beginning said, but you’re no different, huh? Just doing whatever you want in the end."*

*"In the end, you’re just like us."*

Mocking laughter echoed from various gods.

Rian smiled gently as he listened.

“From now on, we’ll select only four more heroes. That will be the end of the gods’ role.”

*"Why four?"*

When Pivua asked seriously, Rian replied.

“The successors of the Wise Queen, the Brave, and the Divine Blacksmith. I believe choosing them is our duty.”

He spoke calmly.

“It’s our duty, having gifted the Hero Record to the mortal realm.”

At his words, the mocking gods fell silent.

*"But that’s only three successors. Who’s the fourth?"*

Another god asked, and Rian responded.

“I’ll get to that later. For now, I propose a vote on whether to record Aru Tune.”

*"Aru Tune... She was acknowledged by the Brave."*

*"Honestly, she’s reached a realm the Brave never did. That ability to harmonize others, can you believe it?"*

*"But she’s never overcome a trial worthy of being a hero. Unlike Lunia El Lunda, whom the Poet of the Star chose."*

*"That’s not true anymore. Look at what she did against that monster. If she’s not a hero, who is?"*

The gods discussed Aru in depth.

There was none of their usual playfulness.

The meeting proceeded solemnly.

They, too, agreed with Rian’s belief.

That choosing the successors of the Great Heroes was their duty.

“Then... do we all agree to recognize Aru Tune as a hero?”

Rian asked as the meeting concluded.

No one opposed.

“Unanimously, Aru Tune shall be recorded in the Hero Record. Her title will be...”

Rian opened the Hero Record.

“The Heiress of Brave's Will.”

Aru’s name and title were inscribed in the Hero Record.

After the meeting ended, the gods chatted.

They discussed the recent events.

As the atmosphere became lively again, Pivua asked:

*"Rian. Among the four heroes you said we must choose, is one of them Kyle’s successor?"*

“Are you crazy? How dare we lowly beings speak of the Hero of the Beginning’s successor?! Have you lost your mind? Go kneel before his statue and apologize right now!”

Rian shouted, even pointing a finger.

Pivua sighed deeply at his reaction.

*"Then who is it?"*

“Our final duty.”

The gods looked puzzled at Rian’s words.

“To choose the hero of a new era and completely end the age of gods. So I now propose one final record.”

Rian took a breath and spoke.

“I ask your approval to record Carl Thomas in the Hero Record.”
