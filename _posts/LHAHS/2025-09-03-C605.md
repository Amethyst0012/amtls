"This room is nice."

Leo, upon looking inside, turned to the innkeeper with a slightly surprised expression.

The inn room was quite spacious.

And although small, each room even had its own hot spring.

"You could've just given us a storage room or something."

"Haha. After hearing your story, how could I do that? Your siblings are going through all this trouble for their older brother and sister!"

The innkeeper laughed heartily and patted Leo on the shoulder.

Then he turned to Marcel and said seriously, "In life, people fight sometimes. But there are far more good things than bad."

His voice dropped slightly.

"I lost my wife a long time ago. We fought a lot too. I regret it deeply. That I couldn't make more memories with her... that I didn't treat her better..."

His face grew wistful for a moment before he cleared his throat.

"Seems like I’m butting in where I shouldn't. Anyway, just relax and enjoy tonight. But! Until early evening, I’ll work you hard, so be ready!"

"I’ll unpack and come help right away."

Nodding at that, the innkeeper left the room.

"So that's why he gave us such a nice room."

Leo muttered and stepped inside after taking off his shoes.

"The floor’s warm."

"This is eastern continent-style interior."

Marcel followed Leo into the room, looking around.

There was no bed inside.

Instead, there were thick blankets meant to be laid out and slept on the floor.

"Haa... I showed some disgrace again earlier. I’m sorry. Even though I knew why you arranged this, I couldn’t control my emotions."

"Don’t worry about it. I didn’t expect everyone to just obediently enjoy a group tour anyway."

Leo said while unpacking.

"Still, if we all spend a day letting things go and cooperating, we might build some teamwork. I plan to do this again after we finish our business in Letin. For a full week next time."

"Hmm... There will surely be some who disobey your instructions tomorrow. What will you do with them?"

"If they want to push me, I’ll push right back."

*‘…I’m glad I came here with Young Master Leo and Miss Chelsea.’*

Marcel breathed a sigh of relief.

"Still, I’m worried about where Miss Chelsea is."

Though Marcel, as a direct descendant of the Zerdinger family and a magic-user, was friendly with Leo, who belonged to the Plov family—

—it was hard to know what Niel thought of Chelsea, who was Celia’s sworn rival.

"But still, a man and woman sharing a room wouldn’t be right."

"Exactly. Miss Chelsea's a grown woman now, so there’s no way I could share a room with her… Yes. That’s right."

Leo looked at Marcel, who trailed off, and casually asked, "Do you want to share a room with Niel?"

"Cough! Cough!"

Marcel began coughing violently as if caught off guard by Leo’s sudden question.

Then he shouted in protest, "What are you talking about?!"

"Well, Chelsea told me you two used to be pretty passionate."

"That was a long time ago! We’re not like that anymore! Just a part of the past! And I've never once—"

"You even considered marriage, didn’t you? Even if you were young, for the heir of the most prestigious mage family in Lewellin to consider taking a knight, not a mage, as a wife… that means you were serious, right?"

For a prominent mage family’s heir to propose to a non-mage—

That’s something that takes incredible resolve.

"……"

Marcel fell silent at Leo’s words and sighed lightly.

"Yeah. When we were together, I imagined that kind of future."

"You were a little wild."

"Young Master Leo, you haven’t forgotten I’m four years older than you, have you?"

Marcel looked at Leo in disbelief for treating him like a child.

Leo just smiled.

"Sometimes, Young Master Leo, you seem like an older brother."

Marcel laughed and shook his head.

"Since learning each other’s true identities, I haven’t had any thoughts like that. I wouldn’t want to be disrespectful to her."

Leo stared at Marcel and asked quietly, "What if Niel weren’t from the Rhoda family?"

"……"

Marcel gave a bitter smile after a long pause.

"That’s not something that could ever happen."

*‘So he still has feelings? Can’t even be honest with himself.’*

Leo clicked his tongue internally and said, "Well, let’s go help with the work."

"Sure."

{bl}

“Chelsea, food’s ready.”

“Okay!”

Chelsea went into the kitchen, picked up the food Leo had prepared, and headed out.

She brought it to a table of waiting guests.

The inn they were staying at wasn’t a high-class one.

So, there were no noble guests.

But it was popular with families on vacation.

"Here’s your order."

Chelsea smiled brightly as she placed the dishes on the table.

"Oh my, such a pretty young lady and so polite, too."

A woman who looked like the mother of the family chuckled.

"Enjoy your trip!"

As Chelsea greeted them cheerfully, the daughter tugged on her mother’s sleeve.

“Mom, mom. I think I’ve seen this lady somewhere before.”

“Hm? Where?”

“Umm… the newspaper?”

“Oh, come on. Why would someone from the newspaper be here? Besides, you don’t even read the newspaper.”

“No, I’m sure I’ve seen her. Right, bro?”

“Yeah. I think I’ve seen her, too.”

“Haha, you kids only look at hero articles when you read the newspaper.”

Chelsea had appeared in the newspaper a few times.

But no one would imagine that the famous "Golden Generation" Chelsea Lewellin of Lumene would be serving tables in a place like this.

So they just assumed, She looks familiar.

But kids were sharp.

Chelsea smiled as she watched them whispering about her.

Cute.

They reminded her of herself and Abad when they were young.

She went back into the kitchen.

There, Marcel was reciting an order to Niel, who was helping serve.

“Got that?”

“Hmph. I’m not deaf, you know?”

“Good. Glad to see your ears work.”

Marcel smiled coldly and walked off. Chelsea shook her head watching them.

Leo spoke to her.

“Isn’t serving tiring?”

“Nope. It’s kind of fun.”

“You okay with customers being rude?”

“Do you think I’m just a pampered noble girl, Leo?”

Chelsea was born into a family with a status higher than most royalty.

She was raised in luxury.

But she wasn’t arrogant.

If she were, she wouldn’t have grown so much.

She became friends with Carl, a commoner, right when she entered school.

Her thinking was flexible.

“By the way…”

Chelsea looked over at Niel, who was chopping ingredients with her arms crossed.

Since she had a knack for cooking, Niel was helping in the kitchen.

Other staff were amazed at her knife skills.

“Wow!”

“She cut through that thick bone in one stroke!”

Her skills, honed as a lifelong knight, shined in the kitchen as well.

“It’s like a cold wind’s blowing.”

“Yeah…”

Niel reacted sharply to the talk about her and Marcel being a couple.

“Marcel still seems to have feelings.”

“What? Really?”

Chelsea’s eyes widened.

After a moment of surprise, she grew serious and approached Niel.

“Niel-unnie, do you still have feelings for Marcel-oppa?”

THWACK!

“Huh?”

Niel had chopped the meat and the cutting board in half.

All the kitchen staff held their breath.

But Chelsea calmly stared at Niel’s fierce gaze.

“Answer me.”

Niel clicked her tongue and replied.

“Why should I? It’s none of your business.”

“But it kind of is, right? My family was part of the reason you two broke up.”

At that, Niel put down her knife and exhaled deeply.

She said, “Whether I do or don’t, what does it matter? It wasn’t your family’s fault, or mine either. We just weren’t meant to be. So don’t worry about it.”

Then Niel took off her apron.

“Sorry. I’m going out for a bit.”

And she left the kitchen.

Chelsea looked at Leo.

“Doesn’t it seem like she still has feelings too?”

“Yeah.”

Leo nodded.

“What should we do…”

Chelsea looked conflicted. Leo said, “It’s their business. Like she said, it’s not something you need to get involved in.”

“I know. But it still bothers me. That they broke up because of our families.”

Before, Chelsea would’ve just shrugged and walked away.

But she was different now.

“Lewellin and Zerdinger constantly fighting isn’t right.”

Chelsea understood better than anyone why Leo had arranged this trip.

Because she knew—

Leo was Kyle, the Hero of the Beginning.

Soon, a catastrophe might come that required the world to unite.

Would it be right for Lewellin and Zerdinger—the two great houses of Lordren—to keep feuding?

After two years at Lumene—

Chelsea had changed.

Celia was still annoying.

But she no longer blindly shouted “Down with Zerdinger!”

She knew what Leo wanted to achieve.

For the present she lived in.

And the future she would live in.

Chelsea knew how hard Leo’s journey had been—and how hard it still would be.

That’s why...

I want to help, even just a little.

Aaron had said, *'Leo would never willingly share his burdens.'*

So she had to help in any way she could.

Leo couldn’t do everything.

So she had to do what she could.

Marcel and Niel’s relationship symbolizes the feud between the two families.

If she could resolve even a bit of that—

“I know they won’t go back to how they were. But I want them to at least clear the air and be friends again.”

Chelsea said seriously.

“Any good ideas?”

While she was thinking, the innkeeper came into the kitchen and saw them.

He grinned.

“Thanks to you two, business is booming! The food’s better than ever! And having such a beautiful young lady and a handsome man serve customers? It’s great for business! You’re doing amazing!”

Clearly pleased with today’s sales, the innkeeper paused.

“Hmm? What’s with the mood?”

“Well…”

Chelsea explained the situation, and the innkeeper clutched his chest as if inspired.

“They are still in a cold war, huh? Then we’ve got no choice but to force them to talk!”

“You have an idea?”

“Leave it to me!”

He raised his thumb confidently.

Leo narrowed his eyes.

This is definitely going to be a reckless plan.

{bl}

Evening passed.

Under the calm moonlight.

Niel walked down the hallway.

What does Young Master Leo want from me?

Her face grew uneasy.

Maybe to scold me for earlier?

If so, she had no excuse.

With a deep sigh, she knocked on Leo’s door.

“This is Niel.”

No response.

Looking puzzled, she carefully opened the door.

“This is Niel. I’m coming in—”

Whoosh!

She felt a presence behind her and turned in shock—

—but Leo pushed her forward and into the room.

BANG!

Chelsea quickly slammed the door shut.

Now trapped inside, Niel gaped in confusion.

Then she noticed Marcel sitting inside, just as bewildered.

A luxurious dinner was laid out before them.

Panicked, Niel ran to open the door.

Clack—clack—

BANG BANG!

“Young Master Leo? Open up! Please open the door!”

Despite her desperate efforts, the door wouldn’t budge.

{bl}

Snap!

Leo snapped his fingers, activating a locking spell on the door.

“Success!”

“Yep!”

Chelsea grinned and high-fived the innkeeper.

“I figured it’d be something like this.”

Leo muttered, shaking his head.

The innkeeper laughed heartily.

“Sometimes, you’ve just got to trap them together! Now, we’ll leave the rest to the lovebirds. You two get some rest! Good news will come tomorrow!”

As the innkeeper walked off chuckling, Chelsea looked at Leo.

“Do you think this’ll help them make up?”

“Maybe. Or it could backfire.”

Leo glanced at the door.

“Judging from their reactions, a little force might be what they need. After this, it’s up to how much they still care about each other.”
