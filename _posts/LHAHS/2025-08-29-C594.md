It was none other than Lumene who won the fiercely contested Festival of Heroes.

Lumene students gathered around the podium where the championship trophy was placed.

Hark, the representative of Lumene students, stepped onto the stage and lifted the trophy high.

“Waaaahhhhh!”

The Lumene students cheered loudly at the sight.

And it wasn’t just the Lumene students.

Humans who had visited Lumene to watch the tournament stood up and gave loud cheers and applause.

Since the tournament was a competition between hero academies representing each race, it was natural for the entire race to rejoice at their representative’s victory.

Students from other schools who had narrowly missed winning after a tough competition wore bitter expressions.

Watching them, Leo muttered, “Hark-sunbae looks really happy.”

“Well, of course. He worked the hardest in this Festival of Heroes. But still, I wonder why he threw himself into it so much?”

Celia tilted her head.

As she said, the one who had performed almost insanely well in the tournament was, surprisingly, Hark.

Until just before the tournament, Hark had shown no motivation, complaining about being used until graduation. But as soon as the tournament began, he charged in with blazing determination.

“He said if he was going to go through the trouble, he’d win that cup no matter what.”

“Ah.”

Celia nodded in understanding.

News reporters kept operating their magical devices to capture photos of Hark.

“Still, shouldn’t you, as the student council president, be the one holding that trophy?”

Celia grumbled a little, and Leo chuckled.

“I didn’t do anything in this tournament.”

Leo had participated only in managing the event this time.

“Well, that’s true.”

Even so, as someone representing the school, Celia couldn’t help feeling a bit disappointed.

“It’s such a great chance to bring honor to your family.”

“Isn’t the title of youngest Lumene student council president and youngest hero not enough?”

“Wouldn’t it be better to take everything you can while you can?”

Celia smiled sweetly and brushed her hair back.

“Anyway, isn’t the closing ceremony next week? Our second year is finally over.”

“We still have final exams.”

Right after the grand event of the Festival of Heroes, Lumene immediately moved on to final exams.

It was an extremely harsh academic schedule, but the students, now used to Lumene’s tough standards, accepted it without complaint.

“I’m fine. I already finished studying for my exams.”

Celia smiled confidently.

“Oh, and by the way, I heard from some of the nobles who came to watch that they’ll soon decide on the territory you’ll receive?”

As a direct descendant of the Zerdinger family, Leo was set to inherit a portion of their vast land.

“You’ll have to visit the Zerdinger family during winter break for that.”

“Really? Got it.”

{bl}

After final exams ended...

As always, there was a mix of joy and sorrow among the students.

Some would remain at the school, while others had to leave.

After the closing ceremony, second-year students held end-of-semester parties in their dorms.

“Waaaah! Xia! Chloe! Don’t pretend not to know me later, okay?”

“Why would we ignore you? We were in the same dorm. Even if we don’t study in the same place next year, we’re still friends.”

“Unnieee!”

Chen Xia gave a bittersweet smile and patted the crying girls on the back.

“There, there. This isn’t the end.”

“Chloe-unnieee!”

“I’m a year younger than you though.”

Chloe looked a bit troubled.

She stood up from her seat after comforting the girls.

“Let’s shake off this gloomy mood. Some are staying, and some are leaving, but the important thing is that we all made it through the year safely.”

There had been several big incidents this year.

Even so, everyone had come through unscathed.

“We overcame difficulties by working together. That was only possible because we became one as dormmates. So, we’ll always be friends.”

The girls who had been crying and the boys who had looked depressed now began to smile.

“Xia, you should say something too as the dorm leader.”

Prompted by Chloe, Chen Xia said, “Thanks for following my lead this year. I was worried at first if I could do a good job, but thanks to all of you, I could fulfill my role as dorm leader. Thank you, everyone.”

Smiling gently, Chen Xia looked at Leo.

“Now it’s your turn, Leo.”

“Thanks for the hard work this year.”

At Leo’s short remark, the students from the Glory dorm chuckled.

“Our class rep always keeps it brief.”

Eliana shook her head.

“Anyway!”

She raised her glass of juice.

“Let’s enjoy this moment!”

Everyone shook off the gloom and enjoyed the party.

“Ah! Professor Sena!”

“Why are you so late? You said you’d come early!”

“Sorry, everyone. The faculty meeting ran long.”

Professor Sena, the dorm master of Glory dorm, finally arrived at the party.

Eliana said to her, “Professor Sena! It’s vacation now, right? No penalties or anything for breaking the rules?”

As Eliana’s eyes sparkled with hope, Sena looked a bit troubled.

“Well, technically... what rule are you planning to break?”

“Not break exactly, just... loosen up a bit.”

Eliana pulled a bottle out from under the table.

“When else are we gonna drink at school?”

“When the heck did you sneak that into the dorm?”

“Gasp?!”

When Chloe glared, Eliana flinched and quickly hid behind Chen Xia.

“I-I brought it with Xia’s permission!”

“Xia!”

“What’s the big deal? We haven’t drunk it yet.”

“Honestly.”

Chloe sighed deeply.

Unlike strict Chloe, Chen Xia sometimes allowed the students to relax.

Watching this, Sena said, “It’s normally not allowed... but since it’s a special day, I’ll let it slide this once. Just don’t drink too much, okay?”

“Ooooooh!”

The students cheered at Sena’s playful wink.

“Why are they all so desperate to drink?”

“Miss Chloe, aren’t you drinking?”

“...I will.”

Chloe pouted her lips.

Once the alcohol started flowing, the party grew even more lively.

“Kyle was seriously amazing! I’ve made up my mind! I’m founding the Church of Kyle!”

“Eliana, you’ve had too much. Calm down.”

Chen Xia tried to calm the red-faced, shouting Eliana.

“Leo, have a drink.”

Chloe came over to Leo with a bottle in hand.

“You seem tipsy.”

“What do you mean? I’m not drunk at all.”

Chloe opened her eyes wide and shook her head.

Leo glanced down at her hand.

She was holding a large glass of strong liquor.

*‘That stuff’s strong, and she’s drinking it like beer.’*

He took the drink Chloe poured and gave a dry laugh.

“Leo! Have mine too!”

“Me too! Me too!”

The dorm students crowded around Leo.

“I’m gonna go on a training journey after finishing all my assignments.”

“I’m going to a villa with her.”

“What about you, class rep?”

“Hmm, I think I’ll be visiting the territory I’m inheriting from my mother’s side.”

“Gasp! Inheritance?”

“Oh yeah, Leo’s a direct descendant of the Zerdinger family.”

“Inheriting land at that age? So jealous.”

Gasps of awe rang out.

“Class rep is totally a bourgeois!”

“Hey, the Raden family is prestigious too. You’re your family’s heir—what are you jealous about?”

“How could I not be? My father said he wouldn’t give me a single coin until I inherit the family. I’m just getting allowance until then!”

“How much are you inheriting?”

“It’s Zerdinger. It’s gotta be a lot.”

“I’m jealous. My family got split during my father’s generation, and I have to divide with my brother. I’m getting way less land.”

“Well, having land at all means you have tax income. Leo won’t have to worry about money while attending school.”

Studying at Lumene costs money in many ways.

Watching the others mumble enviously, Chen Xia tilted her head.

“Is inheriting land that big a deal?”

“Of course!”

“In noble houses, they sometimes have civil wars over it!”

“Really? Unless it’s the size of a small kingdom, what’s the problem?”

When Chen Xia tilted her head, the room went silent.

*‘Oh, right. She’s heir to the Xian Empire.’*

There were two human empires.

The Xian Empire, which ruled the eastern continent, would one day be ruled by Chen Xia.

To her, noble family-sized land wasn’t that significant.

“Oh dear~ Your Imperial Majesty~”

Eliana scooted over to Xia, rubbing her hands together.

“When you become Empress, please remember me! Could you spare me just a bit of land?”

Jokingly, she said, and Chen Xia gave her an awkward smile.

“Even if I become Empress, I can’t just give away land.”

“Why not? When you’re Empress, it’s all your land.”

“Nope, it’ll be Leo’s land.”

“......”

“......”

The students murmured as Chen Xia smiled sweetly.

“Xia’s drunk too.”

“So that means Leo will own the whole Xian Empire in the future?”

“So jealous!”

“Class rep! No—Sir Class Rep! Please grant me some land!”

“Leo! Don’t forget about me!”

Everyone laughed, thinking it was a joke.

*‘But I don’t think she was joking.’*

Leo narrowed his eyes and looked at Chen Xia.

She met his gaze, smiled brightly, and waved.

And so, the joyful time passed.

By late dawn, only Leo and Chloe were still awake.

The drunk students were sleeping all over the common room.

“Hmm—it really feels like the year is over.”

Chloe stretched and spoke. Leo let out a soft sigh of admiration.

“You sure hold your liquor well.”

“Do I?”

Chloe tilted her head.

Her cheeks were red, and she smiled gently.

“Anyway, Leo. Thanks for everything this year. Let’s do our best next year too.”

Leo gave a small smile in return.

“Yeah. Let’s do that.”

After arriving in Delan, the capital of the Dellad Kingdom, through the warp gate, Leo headed straight to his mansion.

*‘I have to sneak into my own house... how ridiculous.’*

The first hero in Dellad Kingdom’s history.

And now a all-class successor to Kyle, the Hero of Beginnings, Leo’s fame in Dellad had long surpassed even that of the royal family.

Even though Leo hadn’t done anything specifically for Dellad, the glory he brought made him a national hero.

*‘Leo, you must sneak in, okay?’*

Recalling Reina’s warning, Leo checked his hood and shook his head.

No one from the Plov family had been able to attend the tournament.

Just being related to Leo always attracted attention.

*‘The Dellad royal family probably blocked them.’*

Now that Leo’s maternal side was revealed to be Zerdinger, Dellad was wary of the Plov family defecting.

They couldn’t afford to lose their first national hero to the Empire.

The Lordren Empire could provide far better treatment than Dellad ever could.

*‘Dad must be stressed.’*

Thinking of his father, Leo gave a wry smile and arrived at the mansion.

“Father, Mother. I’m hom—”

“Oh, Leo. Welcome.”

“...Where are you going?”

Leo blinked at the bustling household.

“We’re heading to my hometown with the whole family tomorrow.”

“Your hometown is Zerdinger, right?”

“Mm-hmm.”

“Why?”

Reina smiled brightly at his question.

“You’re being granted territory, remember?”

“Yes.”

“There’s going to be a long negotiation.”

Territory grants in the Zerdinger family often involved many conflicting interests, so there was bound to be friction when land was assigned to a direct descendant.

“The old geezers in the family council are bound to interfere.”

Leo instantly knew she meant the elders.

“I may be from the direct line, but I know exactly which plots are gold.”

“They’d still give it to me properly even without that.”

“My son.”

“Yes?”

“When they give, you take as much as you can.”

Reina burst into laughter, and Leo simply shook his head.
