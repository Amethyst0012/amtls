["This is surprising. I didn't expect my tail to be caught so quickly like this."]

"I'll be heading to where you are soon, so clean your neck and wait."

["Hehehe. I'm waiting here slowly has its own charms, but... it's bound to get a little boring. So I'll give you an invitation instead."]

"An invitation?"

["Yes. I'll tell you where I am right now."]

"Where?"

["Ho? You're not even a little suspicious?"]

"You want my power anyway."

["So you already know who I am? A senile old man from Zerdinger? Or those despicable shadows?"]

"The location?"

Despite the Hero Slayer's intrigued response, Leo spoke bluntly, as if continuing the conversation was no longer worth it.

["Heheh. Hahaha! I'd prefer to talk with you more leisurely."]

The Hero Slayer smiled with delight.

["The territory of the Plov family. I'm here. I'll be waiting."]

With that, the communication was cut.

Leo's crimson eyes radiated a sharp killing intent.

**GOOOOO—!**

Even the Shadow Lords.

Even Regas, the hero of the previous generation and the greatest knight in Lordren.

They were all overwhelmed by Leo's killing intent.

The murderous aura, flickering like flames, soon subsided.

"It's a trap."

"I know."

Leo replied calmly to the words of Algren, the Northern Shadow Lord.

"It's a trap that can't be avoided."

"......"

The Hero Slayer hadn't just taken Reina as a hostage.

He had taken everyone living in the Plov family's territory hostage.

That's why he revealed his location.

*'It is a declaration of war.'*

Leo smiled chillingly.

It meant he had finished preparing to hunt Leo and was waiting.

"Leo-nim, taking the shadows with you..."

At Anya's words, Algren shook his head.

"No. He knows about our existence. Him mentioning us was a kind of threat. The moment the shadows move, he'll massacre the people of the Plov territory."

"Then Leo-nim has to go alone? That's absurd!"

An upset Anya protested, and Kirin, the Southern Shadow Lord, spoke.

"Leo-nim, a decision..."

"He didn't exactly say I should come alone."

Leo looked at the communication crystal in his hand and spoke.

"But as the Northern Tower Master said, if the shadows move, who knows what he'll do. He was hunted by shadows."

Leo continued.

"He's most wary of shadows."

The Hero Slayer was different from ordinary Hero Hunters who hunted heroes.

They never had a chance to become heroes in the first place.

*'No matter how twisted the gods are, they wouldn't choose such people as heroes.'*

And all Hero Hunters hunt heroes by force.

Whether they were raised that way from birth,

Or blackmailed into betrayal and forced down that path.

Even if they later go mad or become warped and hunt voluntarily, it all begins with coercion.

*'Even if they've turned their backs on the world, in the end, they're bound to chase the light.'*

But the Hero Slayer is different.

He turned his back on the light by his own will.

Solely for his own desires.

Whatever that may be, his root is that of a hero.

That's why, despite having slaughtered countless heroes, he was defeated by shadows.

*'He must know heroes well. That's how he was able to massacre them. But shadows? He doesn't understand them.'*

A kind of natural enemy.

*'That's why he's wary of shadows.'*

It's difficult to track the movements of shadows, who operate silently in darkness.

Taking the Plov territory hostage was likely because of that.

If he senses any shadow activity, he'll start massacring the citizens.

*'And if that doesn't work, he probably thinks he can just run away.'*

If a large-scale suppression force is formed, he'll flee immediately.

He won't fight a disadvantageous battle.

*'Then there's no reason to set a trap.'*

"I think I can take a small group."

At those words, Regas said, "I'll send Zerdinger's heroes."

"No. If he senses the balance is shifting, he'll run."

"......"

"Hero candidates might be acceptable."

Regas and the Shadow Lords realized that Leo intended to go with Rhys and his friends.

"If it's Rhys and his group, maybe. But Celia and Lewellin's children might be in danger."

To Regas's concern, Leo replied.

"It will be dangerous. But those kids can handle it. And I want to show them."

"Show them?"

"The malice of humanity."

"......"

Regas fell silent at Leo's words.

Chelsea, Celia, and Abad would grow even further in the future.

Regas thought to himself, *'The current hero candidates will surpass not only me but even my sons. This is that kind of era.'*

When the Hero Record was discovered, the world rapidly gained strength.

3,000 years ago.

During the Return of the Calamity, the balance tilted toward Tartaros.

Although shards of Erebos were sealed and many legion commanders were destroyed by the Heroes of the Dawn, the world suffered great damage too.

To fulfill their duties, the Heroes of the Dawn sealed themselves along with Erebos in the Hero Record.

And many heroes lost their lives due to the calamity, and although not as bad as that era, the world that had flourished for millennia was burned.

Unlike the world, however, Tartaros still had three legion commanders who had survived since the Age of Calamity.

After the end of the Age of Calamity, a turning point in history emerged.

A time that may have determined the fate of the world.

But at that turning point, the world gained a new possibility: the Hero Record. And barely managed to balance with Tartaros.

Historians say.

>3,000 years ago.
>
>After the Return of the Calamity began the true Age of Heroes.
>
>The birth of a new type of hero who inherited the power of the previous generation.
>
>And now is that very era.

Not only inheriting the previous generation's power, but even the founding heroes themselves are beginning to reappear in the world.

Gods that had disappeared during the Age of Calamity are returning, and secrets of the world never known before are spreading globally.

Unqualified heroes who carelessly bore the title are losing it.

Even the shadows, long discriminated against in the background of history, are being inscribed in the Hero Records.

*'The turning point of history on which the world's fate rests.'*

The hero candidates of such an era will far surpass existing heroes.

Power comes with responsibility.

Today's hero candidates will face greater threats.

*'Among them, there will surely be attempts to crush their potential before it fully blooms.'*

Soon.

*'Or maybe as soon as they reach third year. Celia might be targeted by Hero Hunters.'*

Battles against Tartaros and Hero Hunters are different.

Tartaros is fundamentally irreconcilable.

But the traitorous Hero Hunters are different.

*'They once walked the same path as us. In some ways, more dangerous than Tartaros.'*

Because they can understand us, they can act with more malice.

That's why heroes are hunted by them.

Leo wanted to expose that malice to them.

To help them grow stronger.

*'Even though Reina has been taken hostage... and all the citizens are in danger... he's still looking to the future.'*

Regas looked silently at Leo.

*'Does he believe he can save both Reina and the citizens?'*

But Leo's eyes told a different story.

Regas, who had wandered countless battlefields over the years, looked at Leo and muttered.

*'Familiarity.'*

He was familiar with loss.

Just what had this boy with such a young age lost?

And still...

*'He refuses to give up.'*

There was nothing of a mere candidates in Leo now.

Only the emptiness that can be possessed by someone who has endlessly fought on the battlefield.

As a knight of Zerdinger, and a veteran like Regas, he could feel that emptiness.

*'Once you understand loss, you eventually accept and compromise with it.'*

You end up giving up part of yourself.

Otherwise, it just hurts more.

But Leo didn't do that.

Even knowing he would lose, he showed no signs of giving up.

*'A hero.'*

The image of a true hero Regas had always envisioned.

Regas, who had remained silent, finally spoke.

"Sorry, Leo."

"For what?"

"For being complacent and letting you carry this burden."

"You wouldn't have expected someone in a key position of the family to do that, right?"

Edgerson had hidden his desire thoroughly throughout his life.

They only uncovered it after suspecting something and catching a clue at just the right moment.

No one would have thought someone who fought beside his kin all his life would stab them for foolish desire.

"I was complacent too. And... I don't consider it a burden. It's someone precious I must protect."

Leo smiled.

"So don't worry. I'll definitely rescue my mother."

"...I'm counting on you."

{bl}

As preparations to head to the Plov territory were underway, Leo silently watched what was happening before him.

*["Lady Elsie. Here is tea brewed with morning dew and herbs grown in the purest air of this world."]*

*["Oh my, it smells wonderful."]*

*["Lady Elsie! Here are fruits picked from the deepest forest in the world."]*

*["What a rare delicacies."]*

The top rank fire elementals, who once followed the Elemental Lord of Purification, were serving Elsie with rare treats.

Elsie, returned to her palm-sized form, looked awkwardly at the teacups and fruits her own size.

Only Fiora and Kiran beside her seemed to be enjoying themselves.

Initially, the two foolish phoenix and fairy had aimed for the refreshments, which had angered the fire elementals, but Kiran's words calmed them.

*["We're Lady Elsie's closest aides."]*

*[Cheep.]*

Watching the two blatantly lie, Alty wore a troubled expression.

*["Miss Fiora always had a big appetite, but lately Kiran has been matching her. I wonder if they'll both get fat."]*

In fact, Fiora had once become a chubby phoenix.

*["No! How dare you betray me, my beloved ones! You unfaithful fools!"]*

Meanwhile.

Ishtar, trapped in a dark prison, grabbed the bars and screamed.

The top fire elementals completely ignored her.

"I knew there was strict hierarchy among elementals, but this is a bit much."

At Leo's comment, Laruel sighed softly.

"Even lower elementals have emotions. They must've suffered a lot under the Elemental Lord of Purification. What will you do with Ishtar?"

"Dealing with the Hero Slayer comes first. Let's head out."

At his words, Elsie opened a shadow.

The top-ranking fire elementals entered it, and Ishtar, subdued by Elsie, was dragged in as well.

When Leo opened the door, Chelsea, Celia, and Abad stood outside with tense faces.

Behind them stood Rhys, Ulta, and Jamua.

All six had heard the situation and were ready.

"Shall we go?"

To Rhys's question, Leo nodded.

"Let's go."

Step—step—

As Leo walked ahead, the hero candidates followed.
