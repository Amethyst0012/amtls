Murmur murmur—

An innumerable crowd was coming and going within Lumene.

Seeing this, Chelsea crossed her arms and muttered.

"Never in my life did I expect to see such a crowd gathering in Lumene."

Even the second-year students, who had now grown completely accustomed to Lumene, found the current scene unfamiliar.

Of course, Lumene would invite outsiders for special events.

But it was the first time seeing the entire vast campus of Lumene filled to the brim with people.

"Indeed, even in Lumene’s entire history, this many outsiders gathering is a rare occasion."

As an institution that fosters heroes, it naturally has many enemies.

Its greatest enemy, of course, is the demons of Tartaros.

And not only them.

There are countless forces constantly seeking the chance to undermine Lumene’s influence.

On top of that, many threats target individual students.

Sometimes, political enemies attempt to assassinate potential threats before they grow in power.

Because of all this, Lumene has long maintained an ironclad security system.

Except for prominent global figures and the families of students, invitations were distributed completely at random to ensure fairness.

Therefore, the visitors to Lumene were diverse in both background and age.

“To be able to pull off something like this... I guess that’s Lumene for you.”

Just as Chelsea was once again admiring the school’s influence—

"Miss Chloe Müeller?"

A boy among the crowd called out to Chloe.

Holding a magic staff embedded with sparkling mana stones and wearing a luxurious robe, the man stepped in front of Chloe and spoke.

"It’s an honor to meet you, Miss Chloe Müeller."

"...Who are you?"

"Oh dear, I should have introduced myself sooner. I am Veto Inteum, heir to the Inteum family, affiliated with the Eastern Continent’s Magic Tower."

"Ah, nice to meet you."

The Inteum family was renowned even in the north.

"I read all of your published magic papers, Miss Chloe. Your proposed magical theories always excite me."

Chloe already had quite the reputation in the magical academic world as a genius girl who had succeeded Torua Yan, who graduated just last year.

Unlike Abad or Chelsea, who specialized in combat, Chloe showed exceptional talent in magic research.

"Thank you for your kind words."

Chloe gave a faint smile.

"Ah... so beautiful."

Veto Inteum grabbed his head and gasped dramatically.

Watching him, Chelsea furrowed her brow.

*‘What’s with this greasy guy?’*

"Not only is your intellect dazzling, your appearance is as well! Grant me the honor of kissing the back of your hand!"

Suddenly making a fuss, Veto Inteum dropped to one knee, took Chloe’s hand, and attempted to kiss it.

Just as Chloe frowned and tried to pull her hand back from the sudden gesture—

Thwack—!

"Urgh!"

Betty Marste, Chloe’s mentee from the first semester, suddenly appeared and smashed her elbow into Veto Inteum’s face.

"What kind of rude behavior is this, Veto Inteum?!"

"I should be the one asking that! Betty Marste! What are you doing?!"

"You were being inappropriate to Senior Chloe!"

"Inappropriate? I merely praised her beauty!"

At Veto’s words, Betty’s expression turned icy as she gestured with her chin.

"Take care of it."

Then, first-year students from the Magic Department stepped out from behind her.

"Huh? What the hell, you punk!"

"Where’d this mutt even crawl out from?!"

"Did you just make a move on our Ice Queen?!"

"Wh-what... Gaaah?!"

Regardless of gender, the first-year Magic students surrounded Veto Inteum and began beating him with their staves.

Watching this, Chelsea pulled a small paper bag from her pocket, bit into a cookie with a crunch, and commented,

"Chloe, your followers are starting to turn into gangsters."

At her words, Chloe clutched her head.

Chloe, who enjoyed taking care of others, also treated the first-years with great kindness.

Thanks to that, she was the most popular senior among the first-year Magic students.

And the most fervent among them, Betty, rushed to Chloe.

"Senior Chloe! That pervert didn’t do anything weird to you, did he?!"

"Calm down, he just held my hand."

"With those filthy hands, he touched your hand?! I’ll sever them at once!"

"That’s a bit much."

When Chelsea chimed in, Betty paused, then turned and shouted,

"That perverted bastard! Beat him to within an inch of his life! He’s got the hands of a criminal!"

Both hailing from Eastern magic families, the Marste and Inteum houses had frequent interaction, so Betty and Veto knew each other from a young age.

That’s why Betty knew well that Veto was always trying to flirt with everyone.

Her fierce outburst caused the atmosphere among the first-years to become even more dangerous.

"What kind of disgraceful behavior is this?! Beating someone with a staff as a mage?! Have you no shame?! I never expected the seniors of the school I hoped to enter would be this crude!"

Veto yelled loudly.

At his words, the first-years looked at each other and nodded.

"Oh, so you’re taking the entrance exam next year?"

And their expressions grew even darker.

"This is physical magic we learned from our senior. Magic Swing!"

"Aagh!"

"Magical Fist! You cheeky little applicant!"

"Urgh?!"

"Magic Kick! Bastard!"

"Ugh!"

As the violence escalated, Chelsea narrowed her eyes.

"Where did they even learn such stupid nonsense?"

"From Senior Eliana."

"They’re learning all the wrong things."

Chelsea clicked her tongue.

"Alright, that’s enough."

Unable to watch any longer, Chloe calmed the first-years.

"He was rude, but this is a bit much."

"Ooh, Miss Chloe Müeller... your kindness is as beautiful as your intellect and looks! May I have the honor of kissing your cheek—"

As Veto stood and tried to place his hands on both her shoulders, Chloe shoved him away without hesitation.

"Yeah, better just get a beating."

The enraged first-years once again raised their staves toward Veto.

"There really are a lot of strange people when a crowd gathers."

"Tell me about it."

Chelsea shook her head as she crunched on another cookie.

In truth, the strangest people here were none other than the Lumene students themselves.

Many of the onlookers stared at the scene with dumbfounded eyes, but the students—now thoroughly used to Lumene—failed to realize anything was odd.

Chelsea glanced at the clock on the tower in the street and said,

"First-years, it’s about time to head to the opening ceremony. Let’s move."

"Yes!"

{bl}

A flood of visitors continued arriving at Lumene.

Accordingly, the ships ferrying people to and from Lumeria City were bustling nonstop.

That wasn’t all. All around Lumeria City, giant pillars had risen.

These were magical devices projecting live footage of the Festival of Heroes taking place at Lumene—visible from anywhere in Lumeria City.

Even now, the devices were showing various scenes from Lumene.

Amidst this—

Suddenly, all the magic screens shifted to display Erek Grand Training Ground.

The massive training ground began to fill with Lumene students.

As they marched in, the crowd watching from the stands erupted in cheers.

Perfectly aligned by department, a white-haired boy holding Lumene’s flag appeared at the front—Leo.

"That’s Leo Plov!"

"Lumene’s youngest-ever student council president!"

"The hero whose name entered the Hero Record!"

Leo’s appearance sent the atmosphere surging higher.

Just as the entire crowd was erupting in cheers—

A shadow suddenly formed in the center of the training ground.

Surprised, the spectators looked to the sky.

"...A ship?"

Someone muttered in a voice filled with shock.

Above, a massive airship floated.

Truly a fusion of the pinnacle of modern magic engineering and alchemy.

An airship that once existed only in fantasy stunned the crowd.

"Damien! That’s Damien’s flag!"

"Don’t tell me... that ship was made by Damien?!"

Cries of astonishment burst from the crowd.

Boom—!

The airship landed on one side of the training ground.

Step— Step— Step—

In perfect rhythm, Damien’s students began to disembark.

Small in number, but their intensity overwhelmed the crowd.

Crackle—!

Suddenly, sparks erupted on another side of the training ground.

Crack-crack! Flash—!

With a burst of light, students from Seiren appeared.

"Without a warp gate, hundreds of people teleported at once?!"

"Is such a thing even possible?!"

"Truly Seiren... a school worthy of producing the strongest mages!"

As everyone stared in shock at this unbelievable magical feat—

Screeeeech—!

A tremendous roar echoed from above.

Everyone’s gaze returned to the sky, where hundreds of wyverns soared.

"Not just dozens, but hundreds of top-tier wyverns..."

"Incredible... must be Azonia."

As the crowd gasped—

Whoosh—!

The Azonia students riding the wyverns suddenly leaped off.

"They jumped?!"

"They’ll land with magic, right?!"

As the students began falling from the sky, the crowd screamed.

But the Azonia students didn’t use magic. They fell straight to the ground—

Thud!

—and landed on their feet, rising with sheer physical ability.

Gasps of disbelief echoed throughout the stands.

The invited schools were overwhelming in their entrance alone.

Every eye watching burned with excitement at these outrageous, unconventional displays.

Meanwhile—

Leo passed Lumene’s flag to Elena and walked to the center of the training ground.

**"I hereby declare the opening of the Festival of Heroes."**

"WOOOOAAAAHHH!"

At Leo’s calm declaration, the entire audience erupted in cheers.

**"Each school’s 100 selected first-years, step forward."**

At his words, all students except the selected 100 began to exit the training ground.

Damien’s airship rose once again and headed toward Lumeria Lake.

"Carl, they’re having the opening ceremony with just the first-years?"

Eliana asked curiously, and Carl nodded.

"That’s what I heard."

"What? You don’t know the details either?"

"The Heroic Festival is supposed to be completely fair. Other than Leo, only the professors know the full schedule."

At his words, Eliana nodded.

Meanwhile, the first-years formed a line in front of Leo, nervous.

"First-year representatives, step onto the platform."

At Leo’s command, four students climbed onto the platform.

From Lumene, Luke stepped up with a terrified expression.

From Azonia, the bear beastkin Medvez clenched his fist as he looked at Leo.

*‘This is Leo Plov... the strongest man acknowledged by Senior Aru!’*

Medvez stared seriously at Leo, then glanced at the trembling Luke next to him.

*‘So timid. Scared just from standing here? I’d heard great things, but I guess it was just rumors. Nothing to worry about. I must be more wary of Seiren’s Leah Tingel... huh?’*

He noticed Leah staring openly at Luke and made a baffled face.

Turns out Luke was desperately avoiding eye contact with her.

*‘W-Why is she always like this around me?’*

*‘I can’t forgive this. I can’t forgive this. How dare you enjoy the privilege of being Leo Plov’s mentee all by yourself. You envy-inducing wretch! Unforgivable!’*

*‘...Leah Tingel... to think she’d burn with rivalry toward Luke Elda like this... I was a fool to judge him by appearance alone!’*

Medvez widened his eyes.

*‘Luke Eldar! As an apology, I shall give you my all in battle!’*

*‘Hiiik! What’s with this guy?!’*

As the massive bear beastkin glared at him, Luke grew even more terrified.

Watching this, Damien’s first-year rep, Rixen, muttered to himself.

*‘I better stay far away from those three.’*

Leo spoke to the students standing before him.

**"First-year representatives, recite your oaths as representatives of your schools."**

>**"As a student of Lumene, I vow to challenge my limits!"**

>**"As a student of Seiren, I vow never to betray my belief in myself!"**

>**"As a student of Azonia, I vow never to hesitate to move forward!"**

>**"As a student of Damien, I vow never to doubt possibility!"**

After reciting their schools’ creeds, the four declared together:

>***"In the names of our great predecessors, we swear to face the Festival of Heroes without shame!"***

Leo nodded.

**"With that, the opening ceremony concludes."**

WOOOOOOOOHHH—!

It was short, but left a powerful impression.

Then—

Snap—!

Leo snapped his fingers.

Instantly, a scoreboard appeared above the training ground.

>[Lumene: 100]
>
>[Seiren: 100]
>
>[Azonia: 100]
>
>[Damien: 100]

"...?"

The crowd stared in blank confusion.

Even the first-years on the field looked dazed.

Flash—!

BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM—!

Weapons, magic staves, and summoning orbs suddenly rained down from the sky.

"W-What the...?"

Luke muttered blankly.

"What are you waiting for? The opening ceremony’s over."

Leo said matter-of-factly.

"Y-Yeah... it’s over. But what is this?"

Medvez asked blankly, and Leo replied,

"Since the ceremony’s over, the opening match starts now. First round is a survival game. The school with the last student standing wins. You get the idea, right?"

Leo smiled faintly.

"Now, start killing each other."
