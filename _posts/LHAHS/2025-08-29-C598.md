"Lewellin, you say?!"

"Absolutely unacceptable!"

"For the blood of the Zerdingers to mingle with that despicable Lewellin!"

At Reina's words, the Elder Council erupted in near-convulsions.

Lewellin.

A prestigious magical noble house, considered one of the twin pillars supporting the Empire alongside the Zerdingers—Lordren's top magical heroic family.

From the very beginning of the history of aura and magic, knights and mages have always competed as rival classes.

As a result, the Zerdingers and the Lewellins, who have long coexisted as Lordren’s two great houses, naturally became like water and oil.

“Come to think of it, didn’t Abad say something? That Celia and Chelsea get along fairly well.”

Though they often bicker, their relationship was considered amicable for direct descendants of Zerdinger and Lewellin.

The same applied to Celia and Abad.

“Well, from the entrance exam, the two of them joined forces to overcome the ledge.”

Even among their peers, the two were seen not as rivals, but as partners standing back-to-back.

“Besides, most of the Lewellin people I met were friendly toward me.”

Because of this, Leo never really felt the full weight of the Zerdinger-Lewellin rivalry.

He assumed it was just intense competition between rival houses.

“But judging from the Elder Council’s reaction, I guess not.”

What Leo didn’t know was that the discord was particularly worse among the collateral branches of each house.

While direct-line disputes were a matter of honor to determine which was the empire’s top heroic family...

...disputes among collateral branches often concerned their own interests.

Zerdinger collateral status couldn't be maintained by blood alone.

One had to prove their worth as a knight to be recognized.

Even being recognized as a collateral member came with many benefits.

Thus, collateral families strove to maintain that status by any means necessary.

In that process, they often clashed with Lewellin’s collateral branches in similar positions.

Since a clash between Zerdinger and Lewellin could shake the foundation of the Lordren Empire, it never escalated to disputes between the main families.

If conflict worsened, both houses would step in to mediate.

Still, frequent clashes were inevitable.

“Wasn’t there a major clash between the collateral branches of Zerdinger and Lewellin around 20 years ago?”

Some collateral houses lost their fortunes during that conflict.

Some of the Elder Knights present had fought Lewellin mages back then.

Just as Leo was deep in thought while observing the chaos in the council—

“Reina Zerdinger! Are you saying you’d abandon the house and go against the Zerdingers for your selfish desires?!”

Egerson shouted furiously.

At those words, Reina, who had been smiling calmly, instantly changed expression.

“Watch your tongue. I am not Reina Zerdinger, but Reina Plov. And you think I'm doing this out of personal greed?”

“What?”

“How can members of the Elder Council, who claim to lead the Zerdingers, be more ignorant of the world than someone who retired ages ago?”

The Elders flinched as Reina’s red eyes glinted.

Even without her aura, the momentum of the knight overwhelmed those with the power of heroes.

Whirrrrrr—

“The surrounding mana is reacting?”

Leo stared in shock.

The surrounding mana was responding to the will of a knight who had lost her aura.

The air rapidly grew hot.

It was hard to believe she no longer had her aura.

“Enough.”

At last, Regas, who had been silently watching, spoke up.

“Reina. Though you've severed ties with the family, I don't believe you've forgotten the Zerdingers.”

“…”

“For the family’s sake, I want you to speak your thoughts freely.”

At his words, Reina withdrew her momentum and spoke.

“This is an age of chaos where Tartaros is on the move, and the Great Heroes are reappearing.”

She looked at Leo.

“And in such times, Leo—who possesses the abilities of the Hero of the Beginnning—stands among us. Do the Elders truly not understand what that means? As a hero, Leo already carries the weight of this era.”

Even in the long age of heroes, only a few ever carried the title “Hero of the Era.”

Leo would soon stand shoulder to shoulder with such figures—it was only a matter of time.

And the Elder Council wasn’t ignorant of that.

But they chose to ignore it.

“Like the Great Hero and the Hero of Dawn, Leo will leave behind an immortal name. As a house of heroes, shouldn’t we recognize his worth and allow him to flourish? In doing so, the Zerdinger name would also rise with him.”

“Ahem!”

“Hrmm.”

The Elder Knights showed discomfort at her words.

“Sure, that would raise the house’s reputation.”

“But… is that all?”

The Lordren Empire already spanned most of the western continent.

Zerdinger enjoyed considerable power within it.

Fame gained through Leo would only bring renown.

Unless the Empire pursued an expansionist policy, Zerdinger stood to gain no tangible benefit.

“And in the end, wouldn’t only the main line benefit?”

Leo clicked his tongue at the Elders calculating in their heads.

“Those with more to lose are always the ones who ignore external threats.”

Back in the Age of Gods...

Countless royals and nobles ignored the world’s destruction until the very end.

Because the cost to oppose the catastrophe was too great.

By the time those with the power to resist realized the severity, it was already too late.

“These people are no different.”

The Elder Council failed to grasp how dangerous the current era was.

The Great Heroes had reappeared. The Monster Queen, who had threatened the world for millennia, had been defeated.

Fires of catastrophe were erupting across the world. And ultimately, a fragment of Erebos had resurrected.

Had it not been for Leo, the world might already have been lost.

Yet most people remained unaware of the crisis’s gravity.

Because the danger had passed without their knowledge.

“And now even the supposedly vanished gods have returned.”

To those who’d fought Erebos directly, it was a chilling threat.

To those in peaceful places hearing only tales, it might seem like a hopeful miracle.

“Even in the Age of Heroes, the world faced many crises.”

Not just the return of disasters.

Tartaros’s machinations had repeatedly thrown the world into chaos.

Each time, great heroes saved it.

Just like when the Age of Gods ended.

“Those clinging to power might see this not as a warning, but as the end of all catastrophe.”

“We acknowledge Leo Plov’s greatness. But calling this an age of chaos—that’s excessive.”

Edgerson said.

“Calm yourself, Reina Plov. Don’t be offended if Leo Plov receives less than expected. If your son dedicates himself to the Zerdingers, he’ll enjoy many privileges in due time.”

“Indeed. Reina, we’re not discriminating against you or your son. We share the same blood, do we not?”

“If Zerdinger blood goes to the Lewellins, people will say we abandoned the family for wealth.”

“Besides, the All-Class ability is Zerdinger’s. Letting that blood out is a huge loss.”

The Elders switched tactics, trying to persuade Leo and Reina.

“Giving a large territory to someone so young isn’t wise. He can receive it after graduation.”

Reina looked exasperated.

“When disaster could strike any moment, do you really think the family is more important than the world?!”

“Disasters are merely your opinion. Even if such a thing happened, panicking now is a waste of energy. When the time comes, we can join with the other heroic houses and stop it—just like always.”

“And what about the people who’ll die by then? Before we’re a house of heroes, we’re knights! Aren’t we meant to protect the weak?”

“Reina Plov,” Edgerson smiled faintly.

“You lost your aura chasing that fantasy. Are you still dreaming?”

Tight—

Reina clenched her fists.

Regas, who had been watching, spoke up.

“Things are too heated. Let’s take a break.”

The Elder Knights nodded and left the hall.

“Leo.”

“Yes?”

“Marry Chelsea.”

“Shouldn’t we ask Chelsea and the Lewellins how they feel about that first?”

Leo calmly answered and helped Reina into her seat.

At that moment, Reina covered her mouth.

“Cough— Cough—”

She began to cough violently, and Leo sent mana into her body.

After a while, she settled down and lowered her hand.

“I overdid it.”

Using her momentum had come at a cost.

Looking at the blood-soaked hand, Reina smiled bitterly.

Leo pulled out a handkerchief and wiped the blood from her hand.

“My son is such a good boy.”

While Reina patted Leo’s head, Regas approached.

“You were impressive—just like your younger self.”

“If it were my younger self, I would’ve drawn my sword already.”

At Reina’s reply, Regas smiled bitterly.

“I’m sorry I couldn’t be there for you.”

“That’s the role of the Chief Elder.”

The Chief Elder’s role is to remain neutral and arbitrate family disputes.

He holds ultimate authority to punish the guilty—but only the guilty.

It’s a necessary role in a great family like Zerdinger.

“I’m proud of you for that, Father.”

In great houses, arranged marriages are a duty.

Those enjoying Zerdinger’s privileges must fulfill that duty.

As a knight, one might be exempt—but Reina wasn’t a knight, so she had no choice.

She defied the family’s will and was cast out.

Regas likely wanted to protect her.

He had the power to.

But he chose to uphold family law.

Some may call him heartless, but Reina knew:

When she left, no one wept blood like Regas did.

“You sacrificed yourself for the family, didn’t you?”

“…”

“I’m proud of you for that.”

Regas smiled bitterly and spoke.

“Reina, sending Leo to Lewellin—I can’t allow that either. So stop using it to pressure the Council.”

“Is that you speaking as Leo’s grandfather, or as a Zerdinger?”

“Both.”

Regas’s expression twisted.

“What does Zerdinger lack that we have to send our direct line as a son-in-law? Do you want me to suffer the humiliation of hearing from that witch that we can’t manage our own house? Chelsea should be marrying into our family!”

He seemed to shudder at the thought of the previous Lewellin head.

“Then convince the Council to give Leo a proper territory.”

“That’s not possible.”

“Like the Lewellins would ever marry off a direct line to someone with a paltry patch of land.”

“Frankly, if she did, it would be a disgrace to her house.”

“So what should we do?”

“Well then. Leo.”

Regas took a small paper envelope from his robe.

“This is the first and last gift from your grandfather.”

“Thank you.”

Leo accepted the envelope with a puzzled expression.

“I can’t grant you family land. But giving my personal property to my grandson—there’s no issue at all.”
