“Wow…”

“Amazing!”

Chelsea and Aru were walking down the street with sparkling eyes.

They had passed the entrance of Dragonia and were strolling down the broad avenue.

Temples lined both sides of the road.

Once, 5,000 years ago, they were buildings devoted to the gods. Now they stood empty, with no dragons residing in them.

The place where the dragons lived was much farther away—what could be seen in the distance: the Dragonia Citadel.

And the Citadel, the heart of Dragonia—the city of dragons—gave off a mystical impression beyond anything built by any other race.

Over the past 5,000 years, the world had undergone countless revolutions.

During that time, cultures bloomed and evolved, reaching the present era.

Each race had different tendencies.

>**Humans sought transformation.**

>**Elves valued harmony.**

>**Beastkin pursued tradition.**

>**Dwarves chased efficiency.**

Thus, the four races' cultures developed in different directions.

Yet despite that, one could find many similarities among them.

The reason why different races with distinct traits and tendencies shared such cultural commonalities was simple:

>***Godthrone.***

All four races' cultures were rooted in Godthrone.

The current world had been rebuilt from the ashes of the Age of Calamity.

As a result, most cultural heritages from the past had been destroyed.

In the last surviving city, the various races had gathered and their cultures intermingled.

When the Age of Calamity ended, the traditional identities of the races had faded, and they began developing the blended culture each in their own way.

But there was one race that did not stray from its original path—and that was the dragons.

“I heard that dragons preserved their culture from the Age of the Gods. Seeing this… I totally get it now.”

Chelsea exclaimed in admiration—“Hoo! Hoo!”—as she looked around.

Since the cultural foundations were so different, the architectural styles were entirely different as well.

Just then—

Fwshhh—!

Three dragons flew overhead along the street.

A strong gust of wind blew through, sending their hair flying.

“Leo-oppa! Look at that! It’s a dragon!”

“Whoaaa! Black Rabbit! Look, look! Isn’t it cool?!”

Chelsea and Aru clung to Leo from either side, shaking him excitedly.

The two girls were bursting with excitement at the sight of the dragons flying in formation.

“Hoooh?”

Even Dorberman, a fifth-year from Azonia, looked intrigued, his eyes gleaming.

“They look powerful.”

Perhaps driven by a sense of rivalry, he asked Leo.

“Leo, I heard you’ve had many experiences. Have you ever fought a dragon?”

*‘If you mean fought… then yeah, multiple times. Even with the strongest dragon in history.’*

He’d fought them for training, and a few times because they got angry and started something.

But he couldn’t exactly say that out loud.

In this era, it’s incredibly rare for someone to even have a chance to fight a dragon.

“No, I haven’t.”

“I see.”

Dorberman clenched and unclenched his fist, then gazed up at the sky and muttered,

“Dragons must be strong, right? Definitely opponents worth fighting.”

At that mutter, both Chelsea and Aru—who had been going “Wow! Wow!”—froze.

“Dorberman-sunbae, just checking here, but… you’re not thinking of, like, fighting a dragon just because we happen to be in Dragonia… right?”

“I am.”

“Drop that ridiculous idea right now, you muscle-brained mutt!”

Aru grabbed Dorberman by the collar and shook him fiercely.

It wasn’t exactly behavior befitting a younger student toward a senior, but Dorberman didn’t mind at all.

“Hmph. As always, your wrists are so thin and frail.”

Instead, he frowned disapprovingly at Aru’s arms.

“Aru, you are the next student council president of Azonia. I’ve told you countless times: with a body that weak, you won’t be able to lead Azonia’s wild beastkin.”

“I think I’ve already taught those muscle-obsessed fools a good enough lesson.”

Hearing that, Chelsea tilted her head.

“Aru… you’re the next student council president of Azonia?”

“Heh, that’s right, little squirt.”

At Aru’s words, Chelsea twitched in irritation.

Whether Aru knew she’d provoked her or not, she just kept bragging smugly.

“Just being big doesn’t give you authority! Look at this slender and elegant figure! It might seem delicate at first glance, but! Fierce wild instincts lie beneath! I’m not weak at all!”

Aru proudly put her hands on her hips and puffed out her chest.

Chelsea stared at her.

“You? You look totally puny, like a child.”

“What did you just say, you cheeky little—!”

“Who are you calling little? You’re even scrawnier than me.”

Enraged, Aru lunged for Chelsea, but Chelsea stuck her tongue out and darted away.

As Aru prepared to chase her—

Grab!

“Gyaaah?!”

Leo yanked Aru’s tail.

“How many times do I have to say it! Don’t! Pull! The tail!”

Face burning red, Aru pulled hard to free her tail from Leo’s grip.

“If you’re going to be student council president, shouldn’t you start acting a little more mature?”

“Ugh…”

At Leo’s words, Aru looked pained and then nodded.

“Fine, Black Rabbit.”

“Impressive presence. For Aru to listen so obediently…”

Dorberman pulled something from his coat and popped it into his mouth.

Seeing this, Chelsea asked,

“What are you eating?”

“Meat that helps build muscle. Want some?”

Chelsea sniffed the chunk of meat he held out, then shook her head.

“I’ll pass.”

“Sigh. Picky eaters don’t grow tall.”

*‘Are Azonia people naturally good at insulting others without malice?’*

Chelsea seriously considered this.

“By the way, when did you become the next student council president of Azonia?”

“I won at the Festival of Struggle recently!”

Aru snorted proudly.

The Festival of Struggle.

A ritual held once a year to determine the strongest in Azonia.

It’s a traditional Azonian survival brawl where the last one standing becomes the winner.

The student who wins this is appointed the next student council president.

“Anyone can participate! The opportunity to be the strongest in the school is open to all! Though it’s rare for someone other than a fifth-year to become president!”

“That’s pretty impressive.”

At Leo’s praise, Aru’s ears perked up and her tail wagged slightly.

But she quickly shook her head.

“No! I’ve still got a long way to go!” Aru said with a serious expression.

“I can’t be satisfied with just this! I have to stand on the same stage Aaron once did! I have to keep working hard so Aaron can be proud.”

At those words, Leo looked at the sword hanging from Aru’s waist.

It was the broken Brave that Aaron had left her when he briefly returned to this world.

*‘It was a reward from that campaign.’*

She didn’t clear Aaron’s world, but at the time, Aaron had wanted Aru to inherit the sword.

A gift from Dweno, it had always given him courage.

Now, it might be nothing more than a hunk of scrap, but its symbolism was worth more than any treasure.

*‘That sword is the symbol of Aaron’s courage.’*

She’d only been gone a few months, but Aru had grown stronger.

“If Aaron saw you now, I’m sure he’d be proud.”

“It's still not enough.”

Aru turned her head with a snort, but the corners of her mouth twitched.

With her naturally smug personality, Leo’s compliment made her extremely happy.

“Of course! I won the presidency with my own strength! Unlike that parachute thug from Seiren!”

Aru crossed her arms and raised her chin triumphantly.

“Right, Black Rabbit? Don’t you think so—”

Wham—

“And who’re you calling a parachute thug, dumb cat?”

A foot came out of nowhere and shoved Aru in the back.

Lunia was glaring at her with a crooked smile.

“You’re here?”

“Yeah.”

At Leo’s words, Lunia nodded and brushed her hair back.

“Lunia, there are countless dragons here. As Seiren’s student council president, behave properly.”

Standing behind her, Seiren’s vice-president Hardin adjusted his glasses and spoke.

“Yes, yes.”

Lunia answered half-heartedly, but she straightened her posture and gave a gentle smile.

Seeing her transform into the model honour student in an instant, Chelsea was impressed.

“The Seiren president is getting better and better at acting.”

“Thanks for the compliment.” Lunia smiled softly, tilting her head.

“So, we’re just waiting on Damien now?”

At that, Leo looked down.

“If you mean Damien… she's already here.”

“Huh?”

The ground rumbled, and something peeked out from beneath.

Suddenly, someone emerged from underground, making Lunia, Aru, and Chelsea jump back in shock.

It was a dwarf woman wearing goggles.

“Whew. Dorberman, Hardin… and Leo, right? And Seiren’s president Lunia too. It’s been a while.”

Crack—crack—

The dwarf woman climbed fully out of the hole she dug and slung her pickaxe over her shoulder.

“Whew.”

“President of Demian! What were you doing down there?!”

After calming her pounding heart, Aru asked with a bewildered face. The student council president of Damien, Marigold, answered seriously.

“As a miner, analyzing the geological composition of a new location is just basic practice.”

“You still haven’t broken that habit, huh, Marigold.”

At Dorberman’s comment, Marigold proudly pulled a gemstone the size of a fist from her coat.

“Still, look. Didn’t I find a rare ore?”

“I heard the Demian president was a bit eccentric, but I didn’t think she’d be this kind of person.”

At Chelsea’s muttering, Lunia sighed.

“Damien’s real weirdo isn’t her. Did Drianna not come?”

“If you mean Drianna, she’s over there. She’s also a candidate for student council president, so I brought her.”

Marigold pointed down the road.

Far off, a dwarf girl was sketching the architecture of the dragons.

Leo approached Drianna.

“What are you doing?”

“Oho! Leo! Long time no see!”

Drianna stood up with a bright smile.

“I actually arrived at dawn. But seeing the dragons’ architectural styles inspired me so much! I just had to sketch them!”

They were currently on the road leading from the entrance of Dragonia to its citadel.

There were unused temples scattered around, but no dragons to be seen yet.

To actually see the dragons, they’d need to enter the citadel. This road was just the path leading there.

The two students representing Damien had arrived at dawn and, instead of heading to the citadel, had started digging tunnels and drawing pictures.

“She’s definitely… unique.”

“No kidding.”

Lunia and Aru shook their heads.

“Not exactly the people I want to hear that from, you elf thug and dumb cat.”

“Huh? Did you just call me a thug?”

“You callin’ me dumb? You pervy dwarf freak!”

Lunia and Aru growled at each other.

Watching the three of them bicker the moment they met, Chelsea asked the older students from the other schools:

“Are you really not worried about leaving the student council to those three?”

At that question, the three presidents could only remain silent.

They were undeniably the greatest talents in the history of the Hero Academy.

But still… they were an embarrassment wherever you took them.
