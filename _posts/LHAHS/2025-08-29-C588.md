Posteritas.

This sword could become anything.

If desired, it could be a sword. Sometimes, it became a staff. If wished, it was a summoning catalyst.

This sword, imbued with infinite possibilities, was inspired by Kyle and created by Dweno.

Named “Future,” it was a sword literally made for all classes, bearing infinite potential.

It was also the sword that once disappeared, having gifted new possibilities to the future along with its master.

*‘Why is this here…?’*

Kyle gripped the hem of the cloak he wore.

*‘A subspace has opened.’*

It wasn’t just Posteritas.

The enchantments embedded in the cloak had come alive.

As a result, he could now retrieve all equipment stored in subspace.

As if to say—don’t worry.

It felt like someone had helped him.

Suddenly, he recalled the moment when Necromany Arts had first awakened in him.

The mana of Lysinas had felt almost like it had a will of its own.

Unconsciously tightening his grip on Posteritas, Kyle spoke.

“…Are you here?”

No answer came.

“…Of course not.”

Just as a bitter smile began to spread across his face—

Tap—

Something pushed against his back.

Startled, he turned around—but there was no one there.

“……”

Kyle, looking dazed, turned to face forward.

“Alright.”

He fixed his gaze straight ahead.

“I must move forward.”

With newfound resolve, he fully drew Posteritas.

Whooom—!

The sword responded to Kyle’s mana.

Though a replica created by the power of the Hero Record, the sword reacted just like the original.

*‘Weapons made by Dweno are always fascinating.’*

They instilled unshakable trust.

A belief that they would never betray.

To fulfill their purpose, they served as the user's unwavering pillar to the very end.

Kyle pointed the sword toward the Flame of Calamity.

“Once more… I’m counting on you.”

Whooom—!

As Posteritas responded to his words, Kyle's lips curled into a smile.

“Sir Lumene…”

“It’s Lumene…”

“The Knight of Twilight…!”

Hero candidates gathered around Lumene, looking at him with admiration.

A great hero stood before them.

Kyle, the Hero of Beginnings. Luna, the Poet of the Star. And Aaron, the Brave, had all returned to the world.

Many here had witnessed those events firsthand.

Even so, meeting the Hero of the Dawn did not lose its luster.

The hero before them was one of those who ushered in a new era.

Moreover, he had fought Erebos for thousands of years within the world of heroes.

The hero candidates’ eyes were filled with awe.

Lumene looked at them and asked:

“How did you all get here?”

“…Excuse me?”

Celia’s face showed a flicker of confusion at the question.

“Breaking through Erebos’s flames… should’ve been nearly impossible.”

Walden answered as Lumene looked troubled.

“We simply did as you taught us.”

“As I taught you?”

“Yes. We overcame our limits and reached this place. Just as you did, Lumene.”

For a brief moment, Lumene’s eyes wavered at Walden’s words.

At that moment, Eliza descended from the sky with Aru on her back.

“How was that! You flaming bastard! I kicked you right in the face!”

“For someone who collapsed from exhaustion in one blow, you’re sure talking big. Healers! Treat her burns right away!”

Eliza lifted Aru, whose body was severely burned, and handed her to the healers.

The burns were not from Erebos’s flames—but from Lunia’s white flame.

“You stupid cat! I told you that was reckless!”

“Heh, a glorious wound… NYAAARGHHH!”

Aru, who had been puffing herself up, screamed as the healers began treatment under Lunia’s scolding.

Seeing this, Lumene’s eyes widened.

“Elemental fusion…?”

The ability to perform fusion at will had been a unique skill only the Brave, Aaron, possessed.

Even Azonia, their comrade, had never reached that level.

And it wasn’t just Aru.

Lumene, discovering other beastkin students who had fused due to Aru’s howling, was further shocked.

“We’ve healed the burns, but she’s too exhausted!”

“Don’t worry abou—Urgh!?”

“You’re literally retching from exhaustion, what do you mean don’t worry?”

“Go do that somewhere else!”

Elven and dwarven students flinched and tried to pass Aru to each other.

“So dizzy… urp!”

“Get away from me!”

As Aru was being pushed around, someone stepped forward.

“Time for me to step in.”

“Carl, you only know basic healing spells, right?”

Chelsea tilted her head, puzzled, as Carl puffed up with pride.

“Did you forget I learned Master Dweno’s alchemy?”

“Oh right. You were the school’s top drug dealer.”

“…That sounds really wrong.”

Carl squinted and rummaged through his cloak.

“Just call me the ultimate support unit who can keep everyone in peak condition.”

Grumbling, Carl pulled out a giant syringe.

Aru, who had been nauseated from exhaustion, flinched when she saw it.

With ears and tail bristling, she glared warily at Carl.

“Hold her.”

At those words, Drianna and Chen Xia each grabbed one of Aru’s arms.

“The successor of a hero shouldn’t be afraid, right? You didn’t even flinch at worse injuries, and now you’re scared of this?”

“If it’s gentle, it won’t hurt…”

“NYAAAAAH! AAAAARGH!”

Carl jammed the giant syringe into Aru’s shoulder as she thrashed wildly.

The students of Azonia turned their heads away.

“So embarrassing.”

“Can’t believe she’s our leader…”

“How can we even face Lady Azonia after this?”

“Sir Lumene’s going to think we’re pathetic.”

Hearing their despair-filled murmurs, Lumene thought to himself

*‘…Exactly like Azonia.’*

After watching Aru for a moment, Lumene shifted his gaze to Carl.

*‘But this child… who is he?’*

It was obvious at a glance—he was unlike any of the other students here.

As students from various schools gathered around Carl, who had just injected a special stamina recovery potion into Aru, praise followed.

“Your leadership was perfect!”

“If it weren’t for you, we’d still be struggling with the black flames!”

“So it’s not just brainpower—you’re really skilled. Want to team up for the next joint training?”

Everyone had to acknowledge it.

They’d only made it this far because Carl was here.

*‘So he’s the kind of student who pushes others forward.’*

That meant Carl deserved to be here.

And it hinted at how many limits he must have overcome to get this far.

*‘…He’s done what I couldn’t.’*

A person who had crossed the limits Lumene could not.

The very image of the hero Lumene had so desperately desired to be.

*‘I’m envious.’*

Just as Lumene clenched his fist—

“Sir Lumene!”

Carl approached him, holding out a staff.

“This! Sir Rian entrusted me with this! He said it can destroy Erebos’s core!”

“You keep it.”

“…What?”

“I’ll open the path.”

Carl’s face hardened upon hearing those words.

He understood what Lumene intended.

“Wait! Sir Lumene!”

Lumene sprinted toward the direction of the swirling black flames.

To destroy the core, Erebos’s current form had to be completely broken down.

And with Lumene’s current power—that was impossible.

*‘He’s planning to open the way with a death charge!’*

Carl’s face turned grim.

*‘I have to help!’*

Lumene was far too great a figure for someone like him to even claim to assist.

Yet—Lumene needed help now.

No matter how great, people still fall to their knees when it gets too hard.

And the greater they are, the more they carry.

So when they fall, it's even harder to rise again.

*‘Maybe we can help him stand again!’*

Carl clenched his teeth and ran to Eliza.

“Eliza!”

“Huh? What!?”

Startled by his intensity, Eliza froze as Carl grabbed her by the shoulders.

“Take me into the sky!”

“Ah—okay.”

Normally, Eliza would’ve brushed him off roughly. But this time, she nodded without thinking.

“Everyone! I know you’re tired, but let’s fight with Sir Lumene!”

“We can support him, maybe—but fighting alongside him? We’d only get in the way.”

Drianna’s words were echoed by Lunia.

“She’s right. We might hold him back…”

“Normally, yes! But right now—Sir Lumene needs our help!”

Carl looked at Lumene’s back and clenched his jaw.

*‘This is the problem with truly noble people! They try to shoulder everything, even when they know they can’t!’*

Lumene probably thought he had failed to overcome his limits and now must step aside for the next generation.

That this was how he would fulfill his duty—as a stepping stone.

*‘What a noble soul.’*

Carl had admired him for it.

It was precisely because he knew how truly noble Lumene was that he respected him with all his heart.

But…

*‘Now is not your time to fall!’*

Not because he didn’t want to lose him.

He just didn’t want to see it.

Didn’t want to see the hero he’d admired and been proud of die.

Didn’t want to witness him give up and be defeated.

Now he understood why Rian from this world had refused to help Lumene.

He must’ve thought there was no hope for someone who’d already given up.

*‘Leo, how did you defeat Erebos alone?’*

He remembered asking Leo that once.

Leo had answered:

>“Because I wanted to live.”

Leo smiled.

>“I wanted to live… to see the world they dreamed of.”

Even the Hero of Beginnings achieved that feat because he wanted to live.

*‘If you’re Leo’s successor—then you must live too!’*

Shouting in his heart, Carl declared

“I’ll try to coordinate everyone.”

He clenched his fists.

“That’s all I can do… but I will help Sir Lumene!”

They alone couldn’t lift Lumene back up.

*‘Only someone like Leo could do that.’*

Only a person who had once saved the world could understand the despair of one who had done the same.

But—

*‘We can at least keep him from falling!’*

Carl gripped the staff Rian had entrusted to him.

“That battlefield will one day be yours!”

He spoke firmly.

And the students’ eyes widened.

“That ‘someday’ might be tomorrow! Will you just say you’re not ready and leave it to someone else again?”

At his words, the hero candidates’ eyes burned with resolve.

“Sir Lumene, who told us to overcome our limits, is fighting! So let’s show him!”

Carl shouted.

“Show him that you can overcome your limits at any time! I’ll do everything I can to help!”

“It’s not just you, Carl.”

Eliza clicked her tongue beside him.

“It’s all of us.”

Carl gave an awkward smile at her words.

Chen Xia tilted her head curiously as she watched them.

“That’s strange.”

“What is?”

Celia looked puzzled.

Chen Xia grinned.

“When did those two get so close?”

Just as Celia’s eyes widened—

***"You weren’t merely pretending to be the Fool."***

Fwoooosh—!

A voice from behind froze Carl in place.

He turned—and saw black flames roaring.

Erebos looked at him with a chilling smile.

***"Another fool has shown himself."***
