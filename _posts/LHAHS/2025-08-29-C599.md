"Yes?"

Reina widened her eyes and checked the documents Leo had received.

"This is outside the Imperial territory, isn’t it? And the Lezentan region? How does Father own such a prime piece of land?"

"Yes. Do you like this father's gift?"

"You must’ve been quite the schemer back when you were the head of the family, huh? When did you stash so much away?"

At Reina’s words, Regas covered his face with his hand.

"People might get the wrong idea if they heard you. That land was left behind by your mother."

"Mom? Mom owned this much land?!"

"Your mother was a princess of Tonkan, the Sword Duchy, which governed the Lezentan region."

"Mom was royalty?!"

Reina's expression turned to one of utter surprise at a fact she had never known.

"The Kingdom of Tonkan? I’ve never heard of it before."

As Leo tilted his head in confusion, Regas spoke.

"Of course not. It was a heroic kingdom that fell even before your mother was born."

A heroic kingdom—referring to a nation founded by a mighty hero, possessing territory the size of a duchy.

"Your grandfather was about Rhys' age when it fell to Tartaros' invasion."

Leo looked puzzled at that.

"Then wouldn’t another power have taken over the Lezentan region?"

"The one currently in control of Lezentan is the Tuzen Knights, once the elite order of Tonkan. Loyal to Tonkan, they still search for royal bloodlines even after all this time."

"Why did Mom keep her origins a secret from us? And why didn’t she return to Tonkan, even though she was royalty? If the Tuzen Knights are still loyal, wouldn’t they have immediately made her queen?"

Seeing Reina’s confused expression, Regas gave a bitter smile.

"Had she returned, your mother would indeed have become queen. But Nayla felt deep guilt for failing to prevent Tonkan’s fall. She believed she couldn’t rule over a land she couldn't protect and refused to return to her homeland for the rest of her life."

Nayla Zerdinger, the former mistress of the Zerdinger family, was also renowned as a noble knight.

"Is it really okay to pass that land down to me?"

"As a hero, your goal is to bring about the complete destruction of Erebos."

A dream shared by all living in the world, yet too grand for anyone to dare say aloud.

"Your mother resembled your grandmother greatly."

Regas smiled wistfully as he looked at his daughter.

"She often said that those born with power are born that way for a reason."

"She definitely said that."

Reina nodded.

"That power must be used to protect the weak and the kind—that was your grandmother's conviction. Some mocked it as self-sacrifice, but I believe it’s thanks to such noble people that the world has managed to triumph over great evil. And Leo..."

Regas' red eyes turned toward Leo.

"You are someone who doesn’t hesitate to dedicate himself to the world."

Regas had observed Leo since his entrance exam.

And he had been deeply moved by what he saw.

Not just because Leo was an extraordinarily talented grandson.

But because in Leo, he had glimpsed the shadow of a true hero.

He would pull others forward if they struggled, and support them from behind if needed.

Even though he could easily surge ahead on his own, he never ran alone.

He waited for those who fell behind and grew alongside them.

It was clear from that.

That his seemingly impossible goal of Erebos’ complete annihilation was no mere dream.

"That’s why I believe you deserve to inherit your grandmother's legacy."

Regas fidgeted with the pendant hanging from his neck.

Inside it was a photo of his late wife.

"There are many forms of strength. Physical might is one—but influence, a following, is a great power that can't be ignored."

This was why Reina wanted to pass on a large territory to her son.

That land would serve as a base from which Leo could build his own power.

There is a limit to personal strength.

Only with a loyal force behind him could Leo fully spread his wings as a hero.

*‘The path Leo has chosen will be anything but easy.’*

"If Tonkan’s legacy is used to bring complete peace to the world, your grandmother would be happier than anyone. That’s why I’m giving you that land."

At those words, Leo nodded.

"Father."

"Did this father manage to move your heart?"

"You don’t think this is enough, do you? This is Mother’s legacy. You still owe Leo a proper inheritance from the Zerdinger family. Make sure you calculate that separately. 

Got it?"

"……"

As Reina insisted on securing everything properly, Regas asked, "Just who did you take after?"

"Mother."

Waiting in front of Elder's Corridor, Celia rushed over the moment Leo came out.

"How did it go?"

To Celia's urgent question, Leo replied, "For now, it’s more or less settled that I’ll inherit some land in the Empire’s northern region."

"What? The land our family owns in the northern Empire is mostly barren mountains!"

"When I graduate, I’ll inherit part of the land Mother was supposed to receive."

"That’s ridiculous! Even if you inherited all of your aunt’s estate right now, it wouldn’t be enough!"

Celia flared up.

"You seem more upset than I am?"

"This is about respect! Did Aunt just let this happen?"

"Miss, please calm down."

"Yes, Miss."

Niel and Martina tried to soothe Celia.

"She didn’t just let it happen. She even caused a fuss trying to marry me off to Chelsea."

"Wh-WHAT?!"

"Chelsea? Chelsea of Lewellin?!"

Martina and Niel’s faces turned pale with shock.

"What’s that nonsense?! Why would you marry Chelsea Lewellin?! I won’t allow it!"

Celia’s face turned red with indignation.

Even the rest of Leo’s knights looked stunned, their mouths agape.

Leo said calmly, "Why are you all so surprised? It’s not like I agreed to it."

"R-Right? Yeah! There’s no way you’d marry Chelsea Lewellin!"

Celia let out a relieved sigh.

"So then?"

"Grandfather stepped in and mediated."

"How?"

"In return for going along with the Elders’ decision, he agreed to give me the Lezentan region."

"Lezentan? That’s not even part of the Empire, is it? And it’s not related to our family at all. Or is there a different Lezentan within the Empire?"

"I don’t think there is," Niel shook his head.

"It’s in the northern region of the Empire. Apparently, it belonged to our grandmother."

Leo shared the story Regas had told him with Celia.

Hearing it, Celia’s face lit up in shock.

"What?! Then that means... you’re the rightful heir of Tonkan?!"

"Pretty much."

"Then you’re a king?"

"Does that make me one?"

"You really are something else."

Even inheriting an entire country didn’t seem to faze him.

‘He really has a grand vessel.’

"I plan to visit Lezentan in two days."

"Then I’ll go too. It’s Grandmother’s land—I’m curious."

Celia’s eyes sparkled.

Watching her, Leo chuckled softly and looked down at his hand.

*‘A king, huh?’*

He thought of a friend once called the Wise Queen.

*‘I feel like I’m becoming more and more like that person.’*

After suppressing the Eastern rebels, three people approached Rhys.

"Excellent job, Rhys. To put down the rebellion so quickly without casualties—worthy of my rival indeed."

Ulta threw his arms wide in exaggerated praise.

Behind him, Torua clicked her tongue.

"If it were my magic, I could’ve ended it even faster and cleaner."

"I couldn’t just let guests handle something like this. It could have led to diplomatic problems too."

Seeing Rhys smile gently, Jamua smacked his lips.

"Times like this make me miss our student days."

"Yeah, I agree. Back then, if we got in trouble, the academy cleaned up after us."

Torua nodded in sympathy.

"I can’t understand which idiotic delinquent of a mage and musclehead would’ve done such shameless things. As an honor student, it’s beyond me."

"You were the worst one."

Torua tapped Ulta’s head with her staff.

As the two bickered, Jamua noticed Rhys’ serious expression and asked, "What’s wrong? Something happen?"

"I heard something that’s bothering me."

"What?"

"While subduing the enemies, many of them saw my flames and screamed it was the flame of devil."

"Flame of devil?"

Jamua furrowed his brow.

"Yes. And they were terrified—as if they’d seen it before."

Zerdinger's flames were crimson with the power of the Phoenix.

Different from typical aura flames, magical fire, or even that of beasts or spirits.

Anyone would recognize them as Zerdinger’s flames.

"Your family’s fire is Phoenix’s flame."

"Right. And in Lordren, only the Zerdingers handle Phoenix’s power."

"Maybe they just mistook it for something else?"

"I hope so."

But the rebels had clearly feared it.

For rebels to have seen the Zerdinger flames—something most wouldn’t witness in a lifetime—multiple times was strange.

*‘This is bothering me.’*

"Or maybe, Rhys... I’ve developed a new interrogation spell. Want help?"

Torua sat beside Rhys with a smile.

Jamua clicked his tongue at her.

"Did you already forget we outsiders can’t interfere with this case?"

"Tsk, tsk. Jamua. As I’ve always said—you lack love."

"What does that even mean?"

"Torua’s desire to help Rhys—that’s love. Can’t you see?"

"What nonsense is that?"

Torua grimaced while Ulta spread his arms wide.

"No need to hide it, Torua. I saw you. Leaving Rhys’ dorm window early in the morning on graduation day."

"What?! You two were like that after all?"

Jamua grinned wickedly at Ulta’s words.

Torua responded with a sly smile.

"Yes. But that secret is only between Rhys and me."

"Not anymore. Ulta and I know now."

"No. It’ll still remain just between the two of us."

"How?"

"Simple. Kill anyone who knows."

At those words, Ulta and Jamua bolted without a second thought.

And Torua, looking like she really would kill them, gave chase.

Rhys sighed as he watched them go.

"Some things never change, even after graduation."

{bl}

"I lost them."

Torua clicked her tongue.

"Ulta, fine. But Jamua? That loose-lipped fool needs to be dealt with."

She tapped her chin in thought.

*‘Jamua’s brain is probably all muscle too—wouldn’t mind control magic work extra strong on him?’*

As she pondered and walked back toward where Rhys was, she suddenly noticed someone blocking her path.

A man in a black hood, holding a sword.

*‘A rebel?’*

As Torua frowned in confusion, the man spoke.

"Torua Yan?"

"You know me?"

"I heard you’re a famous hero candidate of this era."

A smirk formed beneath his hood.

"I need to take your magic power."

Fwoosh—

Scarlet flames erupted from the man’s sword.

Torua’s eyes went wide.

That flame was all too familiar.

The very flame she’d seen from enrollment to graduation at Lumerne.

"Zerdinger’s flame?"
