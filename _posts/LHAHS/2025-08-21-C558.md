Erek Training Ground, the site where Lumene’s official ceremonies were held.

Every student from across Lumene had gathered there.

Today marked no ordinary occasion—it was the farewell and inauguration ceremony for the vice student council president.

“Do they usually hold such a grand ceremony for the vice president too?”

Juen, standing at the head of the 1st-year Magic Department line, wore a puzzled look.

“Normally, it’s done alongside the student council president’s inauguration,” replied Sasha, leading the Summoning Department line beside him, as she snapped open her fan with a flick.

“In fact, during Senior Leo’s inauguration last year, he named Senior Hark as his vice president on the spot.”

“Ah… right.”

Since the 1st-years hadn’t yet entered the academy back then, they had only heard of Leo’s legendary inauguration through their seniors.

“He told upperclassmen to challenge him if they had a problem with him being student council president. Aah~ seriously, he’s so cool~!” Sasha squealed, eyes sparkling.

“He really is… I heard when Senior Hark refused the position, Leo just said, *‘If I say jump, you jump.’* I couldn’t even imagine doing that.” Juen shook her head in disbelief.

From the Knight Department line, Haviden chimed in.

“You heard? They say Senior Leo restructured the 2nd-year student council.”

“Yeah, I did. Sounds like they’re announcing the new members today.”

“I wonder who got in?”

The 1st-years were abuzz with curiosity about the newly formed 2nd-year council.

**— Now entering, Vice Student Council President Hark Rigard.**

At that moment, a student council officer on the platform announced Hark’s entrance.

As student council ceremonies were led by students, the professors watched from below the stage, letting the students take the lead.

Hark stepped up onto the podium and looked across all the assembled grades before speaking.

**“For the past year, I’ve served as Lumene’s vice student council president. Thanks to all of you, I’ve had a meaningful and rewarding time. I truly appreciate how you followed my lead, even though I was lacking. But all beginnings must have an end. With graduation approaching, it’s time for me to step down from my duties…”**

His voice was solemn, his demeanor dignified—but his lips twitched uncontrollably, trying not to curl into a grin.

>‘His smile’s about to reach his ears.’

>‘I’ve never seen Senior Hark this happy before.’

>‘Is it really that great to quit?’

The students of Lumene watched blankly, trying not to laugh as Hark continued his speech.

**“My successor as vice student council president is Elena Zeron. I hope you’ll all support her well.”** With that, Hark turned to leave the stage.

**“Do you have any final words for the students?”** the student council officer asked.

Hark paused for a moment, then said thoughtfully—

**“Work hard.”**

Pfft… Puhuhu—!!

He couldn’t hold it in. The joy of escaping his duties overwhelmed him, and he burst out laughing.

<p style="color: rgb(164,23,32); font-weight:bold">"Hark Rigard! Off the stage! Get down and press your forehead to the floor!”</p>

A voice colder than the dead of winter cut through the air, freezing Hark in place.

“Wh-Why?! Leo did the same thing to me last year, told me to obey or fight him!”

“Hoo… I guess now that you’re graduating, you think you can do whatever you want?”

Harrid looked up at the platform with a chilling smile.

“As student council president, issuing a command is one thing. Mocking the student body is another.”

Hark, face drained of all colour, descended from the platform and lay flat on the drill grounds in a deep bow.

Even as a 5th-year top knight and soon-to-be graduate, Hark was nothing but a lamb before Harrid.

While everyone watched in awkward silence, Elena gracefully ascended the platform.

She gently lifted the hem of her uniform skirt and gave a graceful curtsy, her smile poised and refined.

**“I am Elena Zeron, your newly appointed vice student council president. I may be lacking, but I ask for your support over the next year, fellow students.”**

Her elegant demeanour left the 1st-year boys blushing unconsciously.

Even the girls stared in admiration at the perfect model student she appeared to be.

Since entering Lumene, 1st-years had few chances to see Elena in person.

She had been too busy with her duties, and Elena herself hadn’t found much reason to show herself to them.

But the biggest reason was this:

Ever since Leo became student council president, Elena had stopped her usual outrageous behaviour.

To the 1st-years who only knew her by rumours, this was their first real impression of her.

And the image was breathtaking—truly fitting for someone called the Queen of Lumene.

Of course, the upperclassmen thought otherwise.

>‘What’s wrong with her? Did she eat something weird?’

>‘What’s going on? This is suspicious…’

>‘My stomach’s in knots.’

Even the 4th-years—Elena’s own classmates—along with 3rd- and 2nd-years, stared up at her with trembling eyes.

“I heard Senior Elena is terrifying. But she seems so nice?”

“She looks like such a good person…”

“Waaaah.”

The 1st-years were in awe, gazing up at Elena.

Elena possessed a natural charm, a sort of bewitching magical aura that drew attention without even trying.

It was a power that could easily become a curse—but her innate genius allowed her to control it perfectly.

She had once used that charisma for pure chaos.

But now, it radiated as an overwhelming charisma, the kind that captivated crowds.

Elena smiled softly and waved elegantly at the 1st-years.

**“First-years really are adorable. So fresh~”**

“Senior Elena!”

“You’re amazing!”

“Kyah~!”

Excited cheers erupted from the 1st-year ranks.

>‘Don’t be fooled! She’s a witch!’

Upperclassmen watched the 1st-years with pity in their eyes.

**“As the student council president has entrusted me with managing operations, I have selected a new group of council members. Today, I’d like to introduce them to you all. We will begin with the 4th-year student council.”**

As Elena calmly and dutifully introduced the new members, even the professors watching below the stage looked visibly impressed.

They had known Elena was to become the new vice president—but no one had expected her to take the role this seriously.

She introduced the 4th-year council, then the 3rd-year.

Finally, it was time for the 2nd-years.

“Wow, all the 2nd-year top students are in the council?”

“This lineup’s incredible.”

Being a top student didn’t automatically mean one would join the student council.

Which made the 2nd-year council—composed entirely of department top scorers—an extraordinary case indeed.

"Of all people… Eliza Hergin? Now that’s unexpected."

"That delinquent?"

Even among the upperclassmen and teachers, murmurs of doubt and disbelief filled the air.

Eliza’s shoulders trembled.

"This is why maintaining good conduct is important."

“Chen Xia! Are you mocking me right now?!”

Eliza snapped, glaring at her. Normally she would’ve reacted much more harshly, but when it came to Chen Xia, Eliza was oddly weak.

And yet, unbothered, Elena continued to call out the 2nd-year student council members.

**"Lastly—The Acting President of Student Council, Carl Thomas."**

At Elena’s announcement, murmurs rippled through the entire student body.

"Acting President of Student Council?"

"Carl Thomas?!"

The undisputed bottom ranker of the 2nd-year Magic Department.

No, the undisputed bottom of the entire 2nd-year.

Though he was famous for somehow surviving expulsion every semester by miraculously pulling off decent grades at the last minute—that was the extent of his notoriety.So when it was announced that Carl would serve as proxy for the student council president, shock naturally swept the crowd.

“Senior Carl!!”

Juen clasped her hands and bounced with excitement.

“Could it be because he’s best friends with the president?”

“Nepotism? No way…”

But as the 1st-years began whispering, their faces twisted with uncertainty.

“Hey! You guys! Don’t look down on Senior Carl like that—”

“You think Senior Leo would appoint someone as his proxy just because they’re close?” Haviden interjected coolly.

“He survived here because he’s capable.”

“You think the 2nd-year upperclassmen would let someone rise to a high position just through connections?”

“Remember the entrance exams? Everyone underestimated him and got wrecked.”

“Even Professor Harrid said there’s a lot to learn from Senior Carl.”

“When I think about it… I can’t even be sure I’ll still be here next year. That alone makes it impressive.”

The 1st-years began nodding in agreement, now convinced.

Meanwhile, Carl stepped up onto the stage with a deep sigh.

“…I really don’t know if I deserve to be here.”

“What’s that weak tone? You’re Brother Leo’s proxy now!" Chelsea frowned at him.

“You tend to underestimate yourself, Carl.”

That was Elena, who had just turned off the magical amplifier. She gave him a soft smile.

“I don’t assign important roles to incompetents. Have a little more confidence in yourself, Carl.”

“…Thank you.”

“Mm. I look forward to working with you from now on, my slave.”

“Did… did you just call me a slave?!”

“Nope. You heard wrong.”

“I definitely heard it! You said slave!”

“Must be your imagination.” Elena giggled brightly and clapped her hands together.

Eventually, the 1st-year student council members were also introduced.

**“This is your vice president, Elena Zeron. For the next year, I will dedicate myself fully to rebuilding the student council and leading Lumene.”**

>‘Did she just say rebuild the student council…?’

>‘She basically means she’s going to run us all ragged…’

The student council members smiled hollowly.

After the ceremony ended, Juen ran up to Carl.

“Senior Carl! Congratulations on becoming the president’s proxy!”

“…Not sure this is something to celebrate.” Carl smiled weakly.

And as the students began to disperse—

**“Wait a moment.”**

Elena, who had just descended from the stage, stepped right back up again.

**“I completely forgot an important announcement.”** She knocked her fist lightly against her head.

**“This a message from the student council president.”**

All eyes turned to Leo, who had remained silent throughout the ceremony.

**“It’s regarding the Lumeiren Competition. As you all know, this year’s Lumeiren Competition will be held at Lumene.”**

Everyone nodded.

The Lumeiren Competition was an annual event—preparations had already been slowly underway since the beginning of the semester.

**“The president wants to make this year’s Lumeiren Competition a little more… special.”**

“How so?”

**“Not just Lumene and Seiren—but including Azonia and Damien. A full-scale inter-academy war involving all Hero Academies.”**

Silence.

Every student’s expression froze.

Even the professors' mouths fell open.

Hark, who had been kneeling under Harrid’s command with his forehead to the ground, suddenly sprang to his feet.

“Wait—this is the first I’m hearing of this!”

“You told us not to consult you anymore about school matters, so I discussed it with Elena instead,” Leo said with a smile.

“You bastard! This is something you should’ve told me about anyway!” Hark shouted in disbelief.

A full-on inter-academy war with every Hero Academy? That was insane.

All eyes turned toward Elena.

**“It’s going to be a tremendous challenge. We’ll need to contact the other schools and rebuild the entire schedule from scratch.”**

A sigh of relief swept through the crowd.

After all, with Leo as president, all school operations were delegated to the vice president.

Even if the president made a proposal, it would be meaningless if the vice president rejected it.

**“But Lumene’s motto is to surpass limits. If it seems impossible… we’ll make it possible!”**

And with that one statement, Elena drained the colour from every student’s face.

**“If everyone works like dogs, we can get everything ready in time for the Lumeiren Competition. So just know that the war will now involve all four Hero Academies.”**

With that final bombshell, Elena calmly stepped down from the stage.

Screams erupted everywhere.

And then Leo stepped up. 

**“From today onward, Senior Hark will serve as proxy of the vice president. Since we’ll need someone to coordinate schedules with the other schools, please report to the student council office right away.”**

Thud. Hark collapsed back to the ground, his face hollow and spiritless.

“…So this is why you made Elena the vice president…”
