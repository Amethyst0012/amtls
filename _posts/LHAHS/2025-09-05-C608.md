In an office overlooking the government building's garden, a middle-aged man was working on documents.

Knock knock---

At the sound of knocking, a knight entered.

"Commander."

"What is it?"

"You have visitors."

"Strange. I haven't heard of any delegation from Lordren Empire."

Sith spoke without lifting his eyes from the documents.

To that, the knight replied, "They're not from a Lordren Empire delegation."

At those words, Sith's hand paused for a moment.

Then, clicking his tongue, he said, "Send them away."

Sith Zidma.

He was the actual commander of the Tuzen Order, who managed the Lezentan region.

A hero known by the title "Crimson Wave," he was publicly regarded as the ruler of Lezentan.

The Lezentan region became bitterly cold in winter due to the influence of the northern continent. However, in spring, summer, and autumn, it was warm thanks to the presence of fire elementals inhabiting the land.

Moreover, as the region was largely vast plains, it served as the breadbasket of the western continent, where grains grew abundantly.

It was also a producer of high-grade elemental stones, given that a Fire Elemental Lord had long dwelled there.

For this reason, countless countries wanted to trade with Lezentan.

However, the only official partner the Tuzen Order maintained relations with was the Lordren Empire.

Several decades ago---

When the Tonkan Kingdom was massively invaded by Tartaros, most of its allied nations merely watched its destruction.

Due to the massive scale of the Tartaros invasion, they feared the damage might spread to their own lands.

Additionally, as the Lordren Empire---then the western hegemon---dispatched a large force of heroes and soldiers, support requests from Tonkan were denied.

Though the Tartaros invasion was ultimately repelled, all Tonkan royalty either perished or went missing in the process.

Heavily damaged, Tonkan naturally fell and faded into history.

Thereafter, the Tuzen Order, who inherited Tonkan's legacy, severed ties with the former allied nations that had turned a blind eye during their time of need.

At Sith’s sharp response, the knight quickly clarified.

"They're not a foreign delegation. The guests came from Lordren. It's an unexpected visit, not an official delegation."

"Hmm?"

"They're people from Zerdinger and Lewellin."

"Zerdinger and Lewellin?"

Sith lifted his eyes from the documents and stood from his seat.

He approached the large window in the room and looked outside.

Seeing the four figures in the lead, his expression grew puzzled.

"They look familiar."

"That is Leo Plov, student council president of Lumene, and with him are Celia Zerdinger, Abad Lewellin, and Chelsea Lewellin, all from the same grade."

"Ah, the ones making waves these days."

Sith nodded in admiration.

"Then I suppose we should go greet our guests."

{bl}

After identifying themselves, Leo’s group was easily guided to the reception room.

"I heard the Tuzen Order aren't particularly friendly to foreign nobles. I'm glad we were able to meet the Crimson Wave without much trouble."

"That's because our empire has always maintained relations with the Tuzen Knights. Even so, I thought meeting Lord Sith so suddenly would take time---I never expected to see him this quickly."

The Tuzen Order governed the Lezentan region.

Their commander was the highest authority in this land.

Sith had actually risen to the rank of hero.

The master of the fertile land of Lezentan.

In other words, he was essentially like a king.

Even if direct descendants of Zerdinger and Lewellin showed up, such a sudden visit would normally require formal audience procedures.

And yet here they were, meeting directly.

"I'm surprised, considering he must be busy."

Celia spoke in a slightly flustered voice, and a middle-aged knight standing at the reception room entrance smiled faintly.

"That’s because the visitors are Lady Celia and Lord Leo."

"Me and Leo?"

"Yes. The late Lord Zerdinger provided immense support during the rapid reconstruction of Lezentan after the Tartaros invasion."

"My grandfather did?"

"Yes. Despite aiding in the reconstruction, he never asked for anything in return. When Tuzen tried to repay the favor later, he flatly refused. He also never publicized his support for Lezentan."

A deep respect shimmered in the knight’s eyes.

Zerdinger’s support for Lezentan’s reconstruction was likely greatly influenced by his wife, Nyla.

But no matter how much one loves their spouse, helping others without any compensation as the head of a house is not easy.

Especially for someone with much to lose.

*'Now that I think about it, Grandpa hardly had any personal property.'*

Even as head of the house, one cannot arbitrarily use the entire family's assets.

Most form separate personal assets to manage freely.

Especially for the head of a famed hero household like Zerdinger, wealth naturally accumulates.

Regas had none of that.

Apparently, it was because he had secretly supported Lezentan all along.

Listening, Leo murmured, "A knight among knights."

"Huh? Of course Grandpa was the best knight. He was the previous head of the greatest knightly family, Zerdinger. Obviously."

"That’s not what I meant."

Leo chuckled at Celia’s words.

"I meant someone who truly inherited the ancient knightly spirit."

One who does not hesitate to sacrifice for the weak and who fights against injustice---a noble and righteous soul.

The very image of an honorable knight.

There are surely things in this world more valuable than land or wealth.

If no one else knew, the direct descendants of Zerdinger certainly did.

*'That’s why they’re called the greatest knightly family.'*

Celia raised her chin proudly at Leo’s remark.

"Of course, he was my grandpa."

Just as Leo chuckled at her response, the reception room door opened, and a middle-aged man entered.

His first impression evoked that of a stern, upright judge who valued principles.

Leo silently observed the man for a moment.

*'A spiritualist knight… and a strong one at that.'*

An overwhelming presence like a seasoned warrior who had survived countless battlefields.

He was a formidable warrior, on par with the heroes Leo had met thus far.

*'So this is Sith Zidma, commander of Tuzen.'*

Leo looked at Sith silently.

Likewise, as soon as he entered, Sith focused on Leo.

More precisely, he alternated his gaze between Leo and Celia.

The firm eyes of his severe face briefly trembled.

The knights in the reception room bowed to Sith.

"Please excuse us while we speak with the guests."

At the sudden order, the knights looked puzzled but promptly left the room.

Until then, Sith simply continued to stare at Leo and Celia.

After a moment, he spoke.

"The Lewellin mages..."

"They’re my friends, so please speak comfortably."

Chelsea and Abad had already been informed of the situation.

Sith nodded at those words.

"Then let me ask directly."

He stared at Leo and asked, "What is your relationship to the Tonkan royal family?"

Leo looked slightly surprised at the question.

Celia also widened her eyes in shock.

Seeing their reaction, Sith explained.

"My family, the Zidma house, has long served the Tonkan royal family. I myself met the royals once as a child, before the fall of Tonkan. I still faintly remember their appearance."

Records of Tonkan were all destroyed during the Tartaros invasion.

The only remnants were kept within the royal palace, which was now sealed.

No portraits or documents remained.

And since no hero relics existed, even Hero Records could not be opened.

Thus, the only knowledge of the Tonkan royals remained in the memories of those who had met them before they disappeared.

Sith was one such person.

"When I saw photos of the Zerdinger heirs, I didn’t notice---but seeing you now, memories return. Celia Zerdinger, your grace resembles that of the princesses."

*‘Grandfather and father did say I took after grandmother…’*

Celia murmured to herself.

"And you, Leo Plov."

Sith now focused on Leo.

"Your hair color is the same as that of the Tonkan royals I saw."

Photos in newspapers were black and white, so the color wasn’t evident.

Only that his hair was white.

But in person, Leo’s hair matched exactly the shade remembered from the Tonkan royals.

At those words, Leo touched his hair.

*‘My grandmother, Nayla Zerdinger---who married Regas---was said to have dyed her hair ever since joining the Zerdinger family.’*

Neither the Plov nor Zerdinger houses had this hair color.

So it must have come from that side.

"I’ll ask again. What is your relationship with the Tonkan royal family?"

At Sith's question, Celia looked to Leo.

Leo finally spoke.

"I’m the grandson of Regas Zerdinger. His wife---my grandmother---was Nayla Zerdinger, whose birth name was Lena Tonkan."

At those words, Sith’s body trembled.

"Princess Lena?"

Leo handed over documents given to him by Regas.

Upon confirming them, Sith drew a sharp breath.

Included was a pendant artifact with a red spirit stone engraved with the Tonkan royal crest.

Regas Zerdinger had helped reconstruct devastated Lezentan for decades, asking nothing in return.

The Tuzen Knights had hoped to serve under him in gratitude, but he had refused.

Now Sith understood why.

"Why... Why did we… The Tuzen... The people of Tonkan searched so long for any surviving royals..."

Among the young, the name "Tonkan" was already forgotten.

There was nothing left to remember it by.

Tartaros had turned everything in Lezentan related to Tonkan to ashes.

Only the royal palace remained.

Without records, things are quickly forgotten.

Even if one wanted to teach and pass on knowledge, it’s impossible without documentation.

Even the hero who once saved the world had been completely forgotten.

But those who lived under the royal rule remembered.

They remembered how the royal family had sacrificed themselves for the people.

How hard they worked to build a good nation.

"Grandmother... lived her whole life in guilt, unable to protect more people. She felt responsible for the many sacrifices made during the fall of the nation. As the only royal survivor, she said she couldn’t rule over those she failed to protect, and that she was happy as long as the people of this land were happy."

"Ahh... How could she think that way..."

Sith, who had spent so long searching for surviving royalty only to give up, was heartbroken.

He never imagined they had been so close all along.

As tears streamed down his face, he lifted his head.

His eyes now burned with resolve.

"Now all that’s left is to return this land to its rightful ruler."

He looked at Leo and Celia.

"Who is to be king?"

Celia looked at Leo.

"It’s you, Lord Leo Plov."

Sith nodded as if he understood.

"I’ll prepare the coronation immediately! We’ll crown you tomorrow!"

Celia looked stunned.

"Tomorrow?"

"Yes! Lezentan has gone too long without a king! Now that the rightful heir has returned, the world must know---starting tomorrow!"

"But there’s preparation involved, right? A coronation in one day? That’s physically impossible."

"Nothing is impossible in this world!"

*‘This man. He seemed so composed a moment ago. Why is he suddenly throwing reason out the window?’*

Celia looked flustered.

Watching Sith, Leo thought of someone.

*‘He’s like Depeser.’*

Depeser.

The gold dragon who once served Lysinas.

The dragon in charge of Godthrone’s internal affairs.

Normally meticulous, he would also become irrational when it involved great heroes.

His aura and sudden impulsiveness reminded Leo of the long-dead dragon.

Leo laughed and said, "Let’s take our time with that. First---"

"Yes, please speak."

Even his tone had changed to one of deep respect.

*‘The Tonkan royals must have truly been good people.’*

For someone to change this drastically just because of royal blood...

"I’d like to meet the Elemental Lord of Purification."

{bl}

In the city where Zerdinger’s estate lay.

Phaeon.

Reina was walking down her hometown streets with her husband after a long while.

"This place hasn’t changed at all."

Reina smiled fondly as Dade looked at her worriedly.

"Reina, are you feeling okay?"

"Of course. Walking like this actually lifts my mood."

She smiled gently.

The Plov family attendants were fretting about their lady’s health.

"Madam, should I get you something warm?"

"Lady Reina, if you're cold, please wear these gloves."

"Fufu, thank you. But I’m fine now---no need to fuss."

Reina laughed and sighed softly.

"I wish I could have gone to Letin with the children."

"You can go once you feel a bit better."

"Yes."

Smiling brightly, Reina suddenly stopped walking.

"Reina?"

Dade looked startled.

Clutching her right chest, Reina bent over.

"Reina?"

"Ah! M-Madam!"

Dade and the attendants rushed to check her condition.

"Well, well. Still alive, are we?"

A voice came from ahead---and Reina felt her scalp turn cold.

She looked up.

And saw flames.

Fwoosh---

Familiar flames.

*‘My flames?’*

"It’s good to see prey from the past once again."
